0,"10,000 Promises","[Verse 1]
Once we were lovers
Just lovers we were oh what a lie
Once we were dreamers
Just dreamers we were oh you and I
Now I see you're just somebody
Who wastes all my time and money
What a lie
You and I

[Chorus]
What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

[Verse 2]
Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the promises
Turned out to be all lies
And now, now I see that you're somebody
Who wasted my time and money
What lie, oh what a lie (what a lie)
Oh you, you and I, oh you and I

[Chorus]
What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me

[Bridge]
You say I'll take you back
But I close the door
Cause I don't want 10,000 more
10,000 promises yeah
10,000 promises you gave to me

[Chorus]
What about your
Your 10,000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10,000 promises
That you promised me
(what about your)
Your 10,000 promises (10,000 promises you gave to me)
That you gave to me (what about your)
Your 10,000 promises
(what about your 10,000 promises you gave to me?)

[Outro]
Once we were lovers
Just lovers we were
You and I
What a lie"
1,All I Have To Give,"[Verse 1: Nick & Brian]
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

[Chorus: All]
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

[Verse 2: Howie & A.J.]
When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay, babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

[Chorus: All]
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

[Bridge: Nick, Howie, (AJ) & Kevin]
Hey, girl
I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to (all the love I have inside, I love you, baby)
And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
But love is all I have to give

[Chorus: All]
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give"
