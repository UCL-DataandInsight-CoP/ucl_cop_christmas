Christmas Coffeehouse,Daniela Andrade,Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,https://open.spotify.com/track/177r7J6bnoMnW4MQx1GQng,0.616,0.226,-7.552,0.437,95.219,"

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who were near to us
Will be dear to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas now

I really can't stay/(Baby I'm fine with that)

I've got to go away (Baby I'm cool with that)

This evening has been (Been hoping you get home safe)

So very nice (I'm glad you had a real good time)

My mother will start to worry (Call her so she knows that you're coming)

Father will be pacing the floor (Better get your car a-humming)

So really I'd better scurry (No rush)

Should I use the front or back door? (Which one are you pulling towards more?)

The neighbors might think (That you're a real nice girl)

What is this drink? (Pomegranate La Croix)

I wish I knew how (Maybe I can help you out)

To break this spell (I don't know what you're talking about)

I ought to say no no no (you reserve the right to say no)

At least I'm gonna say that I tried (you reserve the right to say no)

I really can't stay (...Well you don't have to)

Baby it's cold outside

I've got to get home (Do you know how to get there from here)

Say where is my coat (I'll go and grab it my dear)

You've really been grand (We'll have to do this again)

Yes I agree (How 'bout the Cheesecake Factory?)

We're bound to be talking tomorrow (Text me at your earliest convenience)

At least I have been getting that vibe (Unless I catch pneumonia and die)

I'll be on my way (Thanks for the great night)

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know

And may all your Christmases be white
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees O hear the angels voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend

He knows our need to our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever
His power and glory evermore proclaim
O night divine O night O night divine

Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air
But his mother only in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
We're walking in a winter wonderland

And gone away (gone away) is the bluebird (is the bluebird)
But here to stay stay stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
We're walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on (later on! ) we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire babe
We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?

And later on (later on! ) we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
We'll face unafraid

We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom Angels greet
With anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding
Good Christians fear
For sinners here
The silent Word is pleading

This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste haste to bring Him laud
The babe the Son of Mary

So bring Him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Nails spears shall pierce Him through
The cross He bore for me for you
Hail hail the word made flesh
The babe the Son of Mary

This year to save me from tears

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

And maybe this Christmas will find us at last
In heavenly peace grateful at least
For the love we've been shown in the past oh
Maybe this Christmas maybe this Christmas
