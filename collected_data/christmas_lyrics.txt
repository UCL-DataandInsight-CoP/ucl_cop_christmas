[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)




[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year




[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So it's Christmas once more




Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock




[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

[Verse 1]
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time of the year




Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow




[Intro]
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Ooh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
(Christmas) The snow's coming down
(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
(Christmas) Lots of people around
(Christmas) Baby, please come home
(Christmas) The church bells in town
(Christmas) Are ringing in song
(Christmas) Full of happy sounds
(Christmas) Baby, please come home

[Verse 1]
(Ah) They're singing "Deck The Halls"
(Ah) But it's not like Christmas at all
(Ah) 'Cause I remember when you were here
(Ah) And all the fun we had last year

[Chorus]
(Christmas) Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas) I'm watching them shine
(Christmas) You should be here with me
(Christmas) Baby, please come home

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 1]
(Ah) They're singing "Deck The Halls"
(Ah) But it's not like Christmas at all

(Christmas) If there was a way
(Christmas) I'd hold back this tear
(Christmas) But it's Christmas day

Oh, yeah (Christmas)




[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 1]
Tonight, I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]
But then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 2]
I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Saxophone Solo]

[Bridge]
And then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree, yeah

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need)
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (Underneath the tree)
You're all that I need (Underneath the tree, yeah)
Underneath the tree, tonight
Oh, you're all I need
Underneath, underneath the tree

[Verse 1]
It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

[Verse 2]
Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you

Ayy love, the wise men followed the star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Ayy love, don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That’s a merry, merry Christmas

[Verse 1]
It’s the most beautiful time of the year

But have a cup of cheer

Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

Happy golden days of yore

Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Santa baby, slip a Sable under the tree for me (mmhmm)
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2: Liz Gillies]
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus: Ariana Grande + Liz Gillies]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed *kiss*
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande + Liz Gillies]
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lie
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

The deed to a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight

With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

And I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Waiting
Hurry, tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight




It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in, the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

I'm driving home for Christmas
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Well, I'm moving down that line

And it's been so long
But I will be there
I sing this song
To pass the time away

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

It's gonna take some time but I'll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me

Driving in my car
I'm driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
Just the same

Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
Oh and feel you near me

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
He's driving home, driving home
Driving home for Christmas

Driving home for Christmas




[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really, I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say, no, no, no sir
Oh, mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby, don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, no, no
Aw baby, it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh, your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh, your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby, you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see, no, no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!




You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice;
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Cause Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
And he knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
I mean a big fat man with a long white beard
He's coming to town




Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Just walking, talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland




Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: "merry christmas to you"

[Repeat from 9th line]




Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring, ting, tingling, too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you

(Rudolph)

[Chorus]
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games

Then, one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

Then, how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

[Bridge]
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer

Then, one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say

T's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the Five and Ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart, right within your heart




[Verse 1]
Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, it just said this
I know exactly what I want this year
Santa, can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Verse 2]
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're coming to town
Santa, can you hear me?
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh, please make my wish come true
Santa, can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I want my baby, baby (oh)
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
We'll be all the love under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Bridge]
I hope my letter reaches you in time, oh yeah
Bring me love I can call all mine, oh yeah yeah
'Cause I have been so good, so good this year
Can't be alone under the mistletoe
He's all I want in a big red bow

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here, oh yeah
Santa, that's my only wish this year (ah)
Oh, Santa! (ah)
Can you hear me? (ah)
Oh, Santa (ah)
Well, he's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here, oh yeah
Santa, that's my only wish this year

Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Intro]
Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!

[Verse 1]
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus (kissing, kissing, Santa Claus)
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom, fast asleep

[Chorus]
Then I saw mommy tickle, tickle (tickle, tickle, Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

[Bridge]
He saw mommy kissing (kissing, kissing, Santa Claus)
I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

[Verse 2]
Then I saw mommy tickle (tickle, tickle, Santa Claus)

Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

[Bridge]
I did! I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
You gotta believe me! You just gotta believe me!
Come on, fellas, believe me!
You just gotta believe me! (I told you, I told you)




[Verse 1]
Santa Baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl, santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Baby a 54 convertible too light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the Fella's that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check out my Christmas list

[Verse 2]
Santa Baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Honey, one little thing I really need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a duplex and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line, Santa cutie
And hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

[Verse 3]
Santa Baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring - I don't mean on the phone, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonight




I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light breathes
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have some snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree

Christmas eve will find you
Where the love light breathes

If only in my dreams




[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"

Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"




[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you




[Verse 1]
Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?
In the lane, snow is glist’nin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin’ in a winter wonderland

[Verse 2]
Gone away, is the bluebird
Here to stay, is the new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Chorus]
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?", We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

[Verse 3]
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Circus Clown
We’ll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

[Verse 4]
When it snows, ain’t it thrillin'
Though your nose, get’s a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Outro]
Walkin’ in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland




[Verse 1]
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
Thought we belong together
At least that's what you said
I should have known better
You broke my heart again
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

[Bridge]
How could you leave Christmas morning?
You broke my heart with no warning
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

[Outro]
This is our last, last Christmas
You broke my heart
Last, last Christmas
You broke my heart
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
You blew it
You do it, do it?

As anxious as a little child
Greet you neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the coming year
(Happiness in the coming year)
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

All these things and more, baby
(all these things and more, baby)
Whoa
That's what Christmas means to me my love

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say

He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day

So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow




Out of all the reindeers, you know you're the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randalph ain't too far behind
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph cause I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy "Child, what have you been longing for?"
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"
And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a shooting star

Run, run Rudolph, Santa has to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl "Child, what would please you most to get?"
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"
And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a Saber jet

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round




Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow (Rudolph)
In a one-horse open sleigh (today)
O'er the fields we go (Rudolph)
Laughing all the way (today)

Bells on bob-tail ring
Making our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

I love those JINGLE bells
Those holiday JINGLE bells
All those happy JINGLE BE double LLES
I love those JINGLE bells

Jingle all the way

(Some other version:)
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Echo: Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead




[Verse 1]
Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 2]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more nights on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams, mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep

Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

[Chorus 2]
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

Let's stop all the fight

[Chorus 2]
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Verse 1]
Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Verse 2]
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed and cover up your head
Because Santa Claus comes tonight

[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Verse 3]
He doesn't care if you're a rich or poor boy
He loves you just the same
Santa knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Outro]
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
It's Christmas morn again
Peace on Earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Dum-dum-dum-dum

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
The snow on the ground, the love in the air
Sleigh bells are ringin'
This is what it's all about
The fire is warm, the angels are singin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas with Joe Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always the time of the year

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Look at the lights
Twinklin' bright 24/7
Every inch of Central Park is covered in white
This could be heaven

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always the time of the year, yeah (woo!)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo, woo, woo, yeah (Every day that I'm with you)
Every day, every night (Oh, oh, all day)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top (And I can't deny)
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Hey, hey, yeah
Everyday, la-la-la
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
No matter the reason, no matter decision
My heart will keep beatin', you better believe
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you




[Verse 1]
Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

[Refrain]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

[Refrain]
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Oh, Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights, keep shining on




[Verse 1]
Everybody's happy
Snow is falling down
Prayers are being answered
Miracles all around
From afar I've loved you
But never let it show
And every year another
December comes and goes

[Pre-Chorus]
Always watching
Never reaching
But...

[Chorus]
This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall
So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white, you'll see me like
You've never seen me yet
Wrapped in red (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Blue is where I've been
Green can't buy me you
Silver bells remind me
That mistletoe's for two
So I found a color
That only tells the truth
That paints a picture
Of how I feel for you

[Chorus]
This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall
So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white, you'll see me like
You've never seen me yet
Wrapped in red (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
I'll never feel you
If I don't tell you

[Chorus]
This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall
So I'm at your door with nothing more
Than words I've never said
In all this white, you'll see me like
You've never seen me yet
Wrapped in red (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)




[Verse 1]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Winter love is spreading everywhere"
Summer came and took off with the Spring
So now we start the Christmas caroling
I'll find my way back home
And light up every tree
We will hang our stockings for you and one for me
Cause Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said "Pack your bags and tell them you'll be there"

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
Home, I'll be home
(I'll be home)

[Verse 2]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Wrap the gifts with all your love and care"
The wind, it blows the snow up in the sky
But I won't let the wind delay my flight

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home
I promise, I promise
I'll be home, I'll be home
(I'll be home)

[Bridge]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Pack your bags and tell him you'll be there"

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas (I'll be home)
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas (I'll be home)
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home, oh
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home




[Verse 1]
Everybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catchin' up with folks we barely know
Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Verse 2]
So, Mr. Santa (Mr. Santa)
Take the day off (Take the day off)
Get a massage (Get a massage)
'Cause we've got this one all under control
A little whiskey (A little whiskey)
We're getting frisky (Ooh!)
And slow dancing to Nat King Cole
No, we ain't stressin' (We ain't stressin')
Just caressin' (Mm-hmm)
Warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' (Nothing's missin')
'Cause you're a blessin' ('Cause you're the blessin')
Yeah, you're the only one I'm wishing for

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Bridge]
I don't need anything
Take back all the Cartier, and the Tiffany's and the Chanel
Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Outro]
(Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Just you and me, under a tree
(Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
A cozy little Christmas here with you

Ho, ho, ho
Shake up the happiness
Wake up the happiness
Shake up the happiness

Verse:
There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's december it
And reassemble it (oh yeah)

Pre-Chorus:
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Chorus:
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness

Verse:
At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?

With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Pre-Chorus:
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me

Chorus:
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

Bridge:
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow and
They believe again

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho

Wake up the happiness
Come on you all

Christmas coming around again eh?
Yeah I mean it must be nearly a year since the last one
Oh it's a good twelve months
Yeah yeah
You getting anything for your Granny this year?
Well I thought about it I couldn't be bothered
Well it's the thought that counts innit
Yeah that's how I see it
What do you fancy for Christmas then
Kim Wilde as usual, kidding myself though arent't I
It's hopeless really it's pathetic I suppose in a way
It is yeah - hello who is this?
Merry Christmas Melvyn
It can't be
Come on Mel how about pulling a cracker
By the look of you darling I think I already have
Get it

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple try to stop
Come on Melly-pops

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
Pumpkin pie anyone?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
This is so corny
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Wow I am in the most almighty Christmas groove
I haven't had this much fun
Since "Two little boys" was number one
If my friends could see me now
How do I look?
Ridiculous
You little tease
A dance, Kimberley?

I do love a nice sax break
Yeah me too Kim, but let's wait till the record's over
Kim do you think our love will last forever?
No
Couple of years maybe?
No
Do you think we'll make it to the end of the record?
How long is that - exactly?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
All together now
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Excuse me can I sing something now?
Get lost Griff!
Well that's nice...

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Root beer anyone?
Later we'll have pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolling
There's plenty of pumpkin pie left by the way
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Do you mind Melvyn?
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Wow yeah that was fantastic
Very nice
Let's do it again! One two three four...
Strewth
Five!

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
He overdid it with the pumpkin pie
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Merry Christmas everybody!
Merry Christmas everybody!
Bye Mel it's been really interesting
I'll tell you who I fancy for Christmas
Who's that
Bananarama
Yeah can't help you there I'm afraid
Oh thanks a bundle!




[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice as shy
I kept my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
"Merry Christmas", I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
And if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 3]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now, I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special




[Verse 1]
Tell me, where did we go wrong?
We should be singing Christmas songs
Instead of shouting all night long like we do
We keep fighting in the street
When we should be home wrapped in the sheets
Putting presents underneath the tree for me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we had our fair share
Of breaking up, and making up
I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up, no

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll be together
Baby, all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Verse 2]
It hasn't been the greatest year
But through thick and thin we made it here
Just keep holding onto me, and I'll hold you
But we made it through the hardest part
And I followed you, the brightest star
I just wanna be where you are, right where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we've had our fair share
Of breaking up, yeah, and making up
But I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up, no, don't

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll have together
Baby, all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Bridge]
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah

[Outro]
If we can make it through December (A-a-all I want, yeah)
Every New Year we'll be together (A-a-all I want, yeah)
'Cause all I want for Christmas (A-a-all I want, yeah)
Is you and me to fix this (A-a)

[Intro]
Ooo, Ooo

[Verse 1: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
But I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

It barely took a breath to realize
We’re going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Pre-Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Verse 2: Blake]
Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along, I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you baby
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas

Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Bridge: Gwen & Blake]
I never thought I’d find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oooh, (thank you baby)

I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Verse]
O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

[Chorus]
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine

[Chorus]
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine, yeah
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine (O night divine)
Ooh, yes it was (O night divine)
Oh, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth (O night divine)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, it is (O night divine)
It was a long night, long night, long night
Oh, oh, oh, woah, woah, woah, yes it was (O night divine)




Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list




[Verse 1]
Baby I will not pout, baby I will not cry
Cause I got your love this Christmas time
When the snow's on the ground and it's freezing outside
I got your love this Christmas

[Pre-Chorus]
On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
Warm me up, with your Christmas love

You are the one, you're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year, my present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love, yeah

Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room
But your kind of a star can't be removed
Like a beautiful carol, I get lost in your song
And I will forever sing along

You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
Warm me up, with your Christmas love

For my very own Christmas love
Give me a kiss baby, give me a kiss baby
For my very own Christmas love




Joy to the world

And wonders of his love

[Verse 1]
We were warm and wonderful
Once upon a time
But now we're frozen, hanging by a thread
Can we wait a minute?
Or can we just try to try?
'Cause my favorite day is coming up ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please, can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'll say to Dad when he sees the empty chair
Don't want to hear my mom say, "Told you so"
Waiting for Santa in my bed is no fun if you're not there
And I don't want to be angry at mistletoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please, can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year

Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Break my heart on Boxing Day
Just, please, can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?

Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly, yeah

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

There is something special
About this time of year
A Christmas feeling's everywhere

But now I'm back
To share my love
Friends are reunited
One big family
Filled with love
To last throughout the year

Snowflakes falling gently
A smell of chestnuts in the air

[VERSE]
I'll hang stockings by the fire
Take peppermint canes out the cupboard
Up to the attic, a box full of lights
So much more we’ve left to discover

[PRE-Chorus]
Ribbons all entangled in the garland
Mistletoe and angel's wings
Might be here for a little bit but darling
If it's with you it’s okay with me

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know what's got me feeling fine?
It's the two of us
And Christmastime
There ain't nothing else
That brings us to life
Quite like ringing bells
And Christmastime

[VERSE 2]
Outside's a caroling choir
The snow is lined around the window
It's cold and baby we're tired
Wrap ourselves up head to toe

[PRE-Chorus]
Listen for the reindeer on the rooftop
He knows who's been good this year
All the elves are on vacation from the workshop
It’s almost here

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know what’s got me feeling fine?
It's the two of us
And Christmastime
There ain’t nothing else
That brings us to life
Quite like ringing bells
And Christmastime

[BRIDGE]
Only Christmastime is like this
Everybody's filled with cheer
I wish we could stop our watches
And keep all the magic here

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know what's got me feeling fine?
It's the two of us
And Christmastime
There ain’t nothing else
That brings us to life
Quite like ringing bells
And Christmastime




[Verse 1]
Oh Mr Kringle, I'm soon gonna jingle
The bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everyone's waiting for the man with the bag
Cause Christmas is coming again

He's got a sleighful, it's not gonna stay full
He's got stuff to drop at every stop on the way
Everyone's waiting for the man with the bag
Cause Christmas is coming again

He'll be here with the answers to the prayers
That you made through the year
You'll get yours if you've done
Everything you should, extra special good

He'll make this December one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again

[Verse 2]
Oh Mr Cringle, I'm soon gonna jingle
The bells that'll tingle all your troubles away

Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again

He'll be here with the answers to the prayers

You'll get yours if you've done
Everything you should, extra special good

He'll make this December the one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waiting, they're all congregating
Waiting for the man with the bag, waiting for the man with the bag

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
"Won't see another one"
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
"They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty, Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum, you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas, your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing, "Galway Bay"
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
"I could have been someone"
Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me, babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing, "Galway Bay"
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day




[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way




It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in, the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart




Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Over the ground lies the mantle of light
A heaven of diamond in the lovely night
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then give him a name and call him Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" And then we'll say, "No man"
But now you can do the job whenever you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream sittin' by the fire
To face unafraid all the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking, walking in a winter wonderland




[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

[Verse 1]
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time of the year




[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles
Will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles
Will be miles away

[Verse 3]
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us, once more

[Outro]
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now




Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo-hoo
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, it's grand
Just holding your hand

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop, pop, pop

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
As they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Ba ba ba ba da




Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time

To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fires gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Let it snow!

Oooooh wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

I don't care!

The weather outside is frightful
But that fire is mmm-delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

Let it snow!

When we finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you'll only hold me yight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!




[Verse 1]
Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree
For me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2]
Santa baby, a 54 convertible too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you dear

Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight

[Intro]
The sun is shining, the grass is green
The orange and palm trees sway
There's never been such a day
In Beverly Hills, L.A
But it's December the twenty-fourth
And I am longing to be up North

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse 3]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Outro]
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
And may all your Christmases be white (All your Christmases be white)
And may all your Christmases be white (All your Christmases be white)
And may all your Christmases be
(All your Christmases be white)
(All your Christmases be white)

All is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Oh, what a beautiful sight
So jump in bed and cover your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
Here comes Santa Claus

[Verse 1]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel

[Verse 2]
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole

[Verse 3]
You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile

[Verse 4]
You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty, wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote:
"Stink. Stank. Stunk."

[Verse 5]
You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled-up knots

[Verse 6]
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super-naus
You're a crooked, jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch
You're a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce




Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: "merry christmas to you"

[Repeat from 9th line]




City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmastime in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it'll be Christmas Day

(Strings of street lights even stop lights blink a bright red and green)
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
(Hear the snow crush see the kids bunch this is Santa's big scene)
And above all this bustle you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmastime in the city
(Silver bells, silver bells, silver silver bells...)




You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history
(Repeat)




Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the earth
The Saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

He rules the earth
With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousnes
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders, and wonders of his love




The First Noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked above and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel




Out of all the reindeers, you know you're the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randalph ain't too far behind
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph cause I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy "Child, what have you been longing for?"
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"
And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a shooting star

Run, run Rudolph, Santa has to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl "Child, what would please you most to get?"
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"
And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a Saber jet

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round




Come, they told me (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
A newborn king to see (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
Our finest gifts we bring (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
To lay before the king (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
(Rum-pa-pum-pum)
(Rum-pa-pum-pum)
So, to honor Him (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
When we come

Baby Jesu (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
I am a poor boy too (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
I have no gifts to bring (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
That's fit to give a king (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
(Rum-pa-pum-pum)
(Rum-pa-pum-pum)
Shall I play for you (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
On my drum?

Mary nodded (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
The ox and lass kept time (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
I played my drum for Him (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
I played my best for Him (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
(Rum-pa-pum-pum)
(Rum-pa-pum-pum)
Then, He smiled at me (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
Me and my drum
Me and my drum




Come a little closer children, I've got a story to tell
(oh gee)
It's about a man you've heard of, and I knew him well
(How well?)

He was born on a cold winter's morning
And went on to gain great fame
But may I begin my story
And refer to him by name?
(Please do)

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul (ooooh)
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman made the children smile they say
And were they surprised when he rolled his eyes
And he came to life that day!

There must of been some magic
In that ol' silk cap they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal!
Were they surprised when he rolled his eyes and he came to life that day!

(But Uncle Jimmy, you didn't finish your story.)
I know, I just paused to catch my breath
(What happened to frosty when he came to life that day?)
Well he got in a lot of trouble, you see?

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
(Where'd he go?)
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there and around the square
Sayin', "Catch me if you can"

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, "Stop!"

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again someday!

Thumpety, thump, thump
Thumpety, thump, thump
Look at that Frosty go
Thumpety, thump, thump
Thumpety, thump, thump
Over the hills of snow

Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents
Countrysides covered with snow
Oh, by gosh, by jingle

Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a Yuletide hymn
Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Fancy ties an' granny's pies
An' folks stealin' a kiss or two

Silent night, holy night
Son of god, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, lord at thy birth
Jesus, lord at thy birth

Ding dong, ding dong
Christmas bells are ringing!

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noël, noël, noël, noël

Born is the king of israel

Hark the herald angels sing, "glory to the newborn king
Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise, join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim, christ is born in bethlehem"
Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the new-born king

Holy infant so tender an' mild
Sleep in heav'nly peace
Sleep in heav'nly peace

[Paul Young]
It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

[Boy George]
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

[George Michael]
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard

[Simon LeBon (Duran Duran)]
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

[Sting]
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears

[Bono & Sting]
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

[Bono]
Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

[Boy George & Others]
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life(Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

[Marilyn & Glenn Gregory]
Here's to you

[Paul Young]
Raise a glass for everyone

[Marilyn & Glenn Gregory]
Here's to them

[Paul Young, Marilyn & Glenn Gregory]
Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

[Chorus: All]
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
My two front teeth
Gee
If I could only have
My two front teeth
Then I could wish you
Merry Christmas

It seems so long
Since I could say
"Sister
Susie sitting
On a thistle"
Gosh, oh gee
How happy I'd be
If I could
Only whistle

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
My two front teeth
Gee
If I could only have
My two front teeth
Then I could wish you
"Merry Christmas"

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
My two front teeth
Gee
If I could only have
My two front teeth
Then I could wish you
Merry Christmas

It seems so long
Since I could say
"Sister
Susie sitting
On a thistle"
Gosh, oh gee
How happy I'd be
If I could
Only whistle

(All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth)
(Two front teeth)
(Two front teeth)
Gee
If I could only have
My two front teeth
Then I could wish you
Merry Christmas

It seems so long
Ssince I could say
"Sister
Susie sitting
On a thistle"
Gosh, oh gee
How happy I'd be
If I could
Only whistle

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
Two front teeth
My two front teeth
Gee
If I could only have
My two front teeth
Then I could wish you
Merry Christmas




[Verse 1]
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Such pleasure do you bring me!
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Such pleasure do you bring me!

[Verse 2]
Every year this Christmas tree
Brings to us both joy and glee
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Such pleasure do you bring me!

[Verse 3]
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Thy candles shine so brightly!
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Thy candles shine so brightly!

[Verse 4]
Each bough does hold its tiny light
That makes each toy to sparkle bright
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree
Thy candles shine so brightly!




(Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas)
(May your ev'ry New Year dream come true)

Frosted window panes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Santa's on his way
He's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me

It's that time of year when the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas
May your New Year dreams come true
And this song of mine in three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing too

(Santa's on his way)
(He's filled his sleigh with things)
(Pretty things for you and for me)

It's that time of year when the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas
May your New Year dreams come true
And this song of mine in three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing too

(Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas)
(May your ev'ry New Year dream come true)

Merry Christmas!




What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The babe, the son of Mary

Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through
The Cross be borne for me, for you;
Hail, hail, the Word made flesh
The Babe, the Son of Mary

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come, peasant, king, to own him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him
Raise, raise the song on high
The Virgin sing her lullaby:
Joy, joy, for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary

(Chorus)
Oh, the rising of the sun and the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ, sweet singing in the choir

The holly bears a blossom as white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to be our sweet savior

(Chorus)
The holly bears a berry as red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to do poor sinners good

(Chorus)
The holly bears a prickle as sharp as any thorn
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ on Christmas Day in the morn

(Chorus)
The holly bears a bark as bitter as any gall
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ for to redeem us all




Gather 'round old friends and neighbors
And share a cup of a cheer
It's that time to cease our labors
For Christmas time is here

Yes, Christmas time is here
And then comes the new year

Drink a toast
To good old Merry Christmas
The best holiday of the year




Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you

Merry Christmas, darling
We’re apart, that’s true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I’m Christmasing with you

Holidays are joyful
There’s always something new
But every day is a holiday
When I’m near to you

The lights on my tree
I wish you could see
I wish it every day
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say

That I wish you merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I’ve just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you

The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say

That I wish you merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I’ve just one wish on this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you

Merry Christmas, darling




Bing Crosby/Max Terr's Mixed Chorus/John Scott Trotter Orchestra

Written by: (See Notes) 1883

God rest you merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

(Oh tidings of comfort and joy)
(Comfort and joy)
(Oh tidings of comfort and joy)
(Comfort and joy)

In Bethlehem in Jewry
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn

The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
(O tidings of comfort and joy,)
(Comfort and joy)
(O tidings of comfort and joy)

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name
(O tidings of comfort and joy,)
(Comfort and joy)
{O tidings of comfort and joy}

I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams




[Verse 1: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, "No, no, no, sir" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Get over that cold out)
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside




The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding
Ooh, ooh
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo doo-doo

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ahh, and don't look down

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong

The party's on
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
Ohh, and that's enough

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-ohh
Christmastime




Bing Crosby/Bob Crosby Orchestra

Written by:

Peaked Billboard position #18 in 1943

One minute to midnight
One minute to go
One minute to say good-bye
Before we say hello

Let's start the new year right
Twelve o'clock tonight
When they dim the light
Let's begin

Kissing the old year out
Kissing the new year in

Let's watch the old year die
With a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high
As a kite

How can our love go wrong if
We start the new year right?

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Let's watch the old year die
With a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high
As a kite

How can our love go wrong if
We start the new year right?




[Chorus]
Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight

[Verse 1]
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
"Won't see another one"
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
"They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty, Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum, you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas, your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing, "Galway Bay"
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
"I could have been someone"
Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me, babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing, "Galway Bay"
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day




[Instrumental]




[Intro]
Dum-dum-dum-dum

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
The snow on the ground, the love in the air
Sleigh bells are ringin'
This is what it's all about
The fire is warm, the angels are singin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas with Joe Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always the time of the year

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Look at the lights
Twinklin' bright 24/7
Every inch of Central Park is covered in white
This could be heaven

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always the time of the year, yeah (woo!)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo, woo, woo, yeah (Every day that I'm with you)
Every day, every night (Oh, oh, all day)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top (And I can't deny)
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Hey, hey, yeah
Everyday, la-la-la
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
No matter the reason, no matter decision
My heart will keep beatin', you better believe
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you




[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year




[Verse 1]
It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

[Verse 2]
Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street, Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

[Bridge]
Ayy love, the wise men followed the star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Ayy love, don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That’s a merry, merry Christmas

[Verse 1]
It’s the most beautiful time of the year

Show me, baby, that you love me so-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me, baby, that you love me so-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh




[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)




Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

[Instrumental]

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year




[Verse 1]
You shake me up and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Verse 2]
Outside it's coming down
But here inside, it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Bridge]
The winter is so gray, feels like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me, you know you melt it all away

[Chorus]
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Oh, so glittery
I love the way you decorate my heart




[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 1]
Tonight, I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]
But then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 2]
I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Saxophone Solo]

[Bridge]
And then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree, yeah

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need)
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (Underneath the tree)
You're all that I need (Underneath the tree, yeah)
Underneath the tree, tonight
Oh, you're all I need
Underneath, underneath the tree




[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Every year around this time, I start to think about you
We're really gonna have another Christmas Eve without you
I can't believe it's been so long
Everyday finds a way to make me think about you
Like today when we were picking out the tree without you
I can't believe it's been so long

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we miss you like hell, all the stories that you'd tell
'Bout the boat that you built, but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost, I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

[Verse 2]
Another year has passed and now it's time for buying the presents
I even got you one forgetting you're not gonna get it
I can't believe it's been so long
This time around we'll try to smile 'cause we're sick of tears
Most days are easy now, but it gets hard this time of year
I can't believe you're really gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we miss you like hell, all the stories that you'd tell
'Bout the boat that you built, but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost, I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still
Wild and free, I've got so many memories
Soon time too will take it all of 'em from me
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
When it's dark and it's cold, everyone is coming home
I just wish you could know that's when we're missin' you the most
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears
But if you were here we would

[Chorus]
Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost, I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still
Wild and free, I've got so many memories
Soon time too will take it all of 'em from me
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here




[Verse 1: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I really can't stay (Baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, I can call you a ride)
This evening has been (I'm so glad that you dropped in)
So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise)
My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait, what are you still livin' home for?)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Your driver, his name is Murray)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh, we're both adults, so who's keepin' score?)
What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice)
If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice)
Ooh, you really know how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To cast a spell (One look at you and then I fell)
I ought to say, "No, no, no, sir" (Then you really ought to go, go, go)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (Well, Murray, he just pulled up outside)

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson, John Legend & Both]
Oh, I really can't stay
(I understand, baby)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I simply should go (Text me when you get home)
Oh, I'm supposed to say no (Mm, I guess that's respectable)
This welcome has been (I've been lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (But you better go before it storms)
My sister will be suspicious (Well, gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Oh, he loves my music, baby, I'm sure)
My gossipy neighbor is vicious (I'm a genie, tell me what your wish is)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Oh, that's somethin' we should probably explore)
I've got to get home (Oh, baby, I'm well aware)
Say, lend me a coat (Oh, keep it girl, I don't care)
You've really been grand (I feel it when you touch my hands)
But don't you see? (I want you to stay, it's not up to me)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Well, they can talk, but what do they know?)
At least there will be plenty implied (Oh, let them mind their business and go-)
Uh, ma'am, I really can't stay

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Both]
Baby, just go
It's cold, baby
It's cold, baby
But, ooh, I don't wanna go
It's cold outside




[Verse 1]
Tell me, where did we go wrong?
We should be singing Christmas songs
Instead of shouting all night long like we do
We keep fighting in the street
When we should be home wrapped in the sheets
Putting presents underneath the tree for me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we had our fair share
Of breaking up, and making up
I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up, no

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll be together
Baby, all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Verse 2]
It hasn't been the greatest year
But through thick and thin we made it here
Just keep holding onto me, and I'll hold you
But we made it through the hardest part
And I followed you, the brightest star
I just wanna be where you are, right where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we've had our fair share
Of breaking up, yeah, and making up
But I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up, no, don't

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll have together
Baby, all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Bridge]
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah

[Outro]
If we can make it through December (A-a-all I want, yeah)
Every New Year we'll be together (A-a-all I want, yeah)
'Cause all I want for Christmas (A-a-all I want, yeah)
Is you and me to fix this (A-a)




[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you




[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Santa baby, slip a Sable under the tree for me (mmhmm)
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2: Liz Gillies]
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus: Ariana Grande + Liz Gillies]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed *kiss*
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande + Liz Gillies]
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lie
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 4: Ariana Grande]
Santa honey, the one little thing I really need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus: Liz Gillies + Ariana Grande]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

[Bridge: Ariana Grande + Liz Gillies]
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
And I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Outro: Ariana Grande + Liz Gillies]
Waiting
Hurry, tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight




[Verse 1]
Everybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catchin' up with folks we barely know
Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Verse 2]
So, Mr. Santa (Mr. Santa)
Take the day off (Take the day off)
Get a massage (Get a massage)
'Cause we've got this one all under control
A little whiskey (A little whiskey)
We're getting frisky (Ooh!)
And slow dancing to Nat King Cole
No, we ain't stressin' (We ain't stressin')
Just caressin' (Mm-hmm)
Warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' (Nothing's missin')
'Cause you're a blessin' ('Cause you're the blessin')
Yeah, you're the only one I'm wishing for

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Bridge]
I don't need anything
Take back all the Cartier, and the Tiffany's and the Chanel
Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Outro]
(Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Just you and me, under a tree
(Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
A cozy little Christmas here with you




Bells will be ringing this sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There will be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again

Ooh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again




Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on your troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on your troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now




[Verse 1]
We were warm and wonderful
Once upon a time
But now we're frozen, hanging by a thread
Can we wait a minute?
Or can we just try to try?
'Cause my favorite day is coming up ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please, can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'll say to Dad when he sees the empty chair
Don't want to hear my mom say, "Told you so"
Waiting for Santa in my bed is no fun if you're not there
And I don't want to be angry at mistletoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please, can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

[Bridge]
Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Break my heart on Boxing Day
Just, please, can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas (Yeah)
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

Ooo, Ooo

[Verse 1: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
But I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

It barely took a breath to realize
We’re going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Pre-Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Verse 2: Blake]
Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along, I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you baby
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas

[Pre-Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Bridge: Gwen & Blake]
I never thought I’d find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oooh, (thank you baby)

[Outro: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas




I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days
Be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days
Be merry and bright
May all your Christmas' be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white




[Verse 1]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Winter love is spreading everywhere"
Summer came and took off with the Spring
So now we start the Christmas caroling
I'll find my way back home
And light up every tree
We will hang our stockings for you and one for me
Cause Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said "Pack your bags and tell them you'll be there"

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
Home, I'll be home
(I'll be home)

[Verse 2]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Wrap the gifts with all your love and care"
The wind, it blows the snow up in the sky
But I won't let the wind delay my flight

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home
I promise, I promise
I'll be home, I'll be home
(I'll be home)

[Bridge]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Pack your bags and tell him you'll be there"

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas (I'll be home)
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas (I'll be home)

I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home

I'm sorry, I ain't been around
But you've been on my mind a million times

We'll wrap the presents
And put up the tree together
Be together
Baby, there's no better gift
And now that I have you here
That's when I feel it the most

[Chorus: Leigh-Anne Pinnock with Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall]
'Cause I've been gone so long
But I kept holding on

I've waited all year to be near
To the one I've been missing
This Christmas

[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson with All]
I've felt too lonely to sleep
Boy, when you're on the wrong side of the world
Now with the snow at our feet (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
We'll sit by the fire
And we'll set the scene together
Dream together
Baby, there's no better gift (Ooh-ooh-ahh)
Now that I have you here (Have you here)
That's when I feel it the most

[Chorus: Perrie Edwards with All, Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock & (Jesy Nelson)]

To the one I've been missing




Just hear those sleigh bells ringling ting ting tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Baby
Here we go
Altogether

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
My baby

Aahh, aahh, aahh, aahh

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you




[Verse 1: Scott]
I’ve heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2: Avi]
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 3: Kirstin]
Well baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a vict'ry march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 4: Mitch]
Well, maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it’s not a cry that you hear at night
It’s not somebody who's seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Outro]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah




[Verse 1]
Nights are getting shorter now
Hot chocolate fills the air and Christmas cheer does too
Picking out your Christmas tree, so lovely
The joy this time it brings to you

[Chorus]
Sidewalks covered up in snow
Lights up everywhere we go
Santa's on his way
It’s Christmas every day

[Verse 1]
It's here again
Finally the season went
Everybody's caroling
Peace on earth, good will
To everyone
Children all having fun
Waiting on Santa to come
With the bag full of Christmas cheer

[Pre-Chorus]
It all goes by so fast
If only I can make this last

[Chorus]
Sidewalks covered up in snow
Lights up everywhere we go
Santa’s on his way
It's Christmas every day
Friends all warmed up by the fire
Sometimes I just wish that I
Could always feel this way
Like it's Christmas every day

[Verse 2]
As for me
There's nothing like a Christmas tree
Surrounded by family
Deck the Halls with bounds
Of evergreen, let's pop some
Gonna watch our favorite scene
Where the angel gets his wings
With every bell that rings

[Pre-Chorus]
It all goes by so fast
If only I can make this last

[Chorus]
Sidewalks covered up in snow
Lights up everywhere we go
Santa's on his way
It's Christmas every day
Friends all warmed up by the fire
Sometimes I just wish that I
Could always feel this way
Like it's Christmas every day
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Christmas every day

[Bridge]
If I could have one more gift just for me
Joy to the world it would be
With more Christmases under the tree

[Chorus]
Sidewalks covered up in snow
Lights up everywhere we go
Santa’s on his way
It’s Christmas every day
Friends all warmed up by the fire
Sometimes I just wish that I
Could always feel this way
Like it's Christmas every day
Sidewalks covered up in snow
Lights up everywhere we go
Santa’s on his way
It's Christmas every day
Friends all warmed up by the fire
Sometimes I just wish that I
Could always feel this way
Like it's Christmas every day




[Verse 1]
The whole world feels a little bit more love
When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
And everywhere that you go
There's people singing "Let It Snow"
And hanging up that mistletoe

[Hook]
And me and you gonna have ourselves a holiday
And we don't need nobody else to celebrate
And we're gonna kiss our worries and our cares away
I can't wait

[Chorus]
Because this Christmas time get together
It's gonna be so nice, better than ever
And baby you're the one special treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
Until Christmas comes
Oh baby, oh baby

[Verse 2]
So many souls hurt
So many don't have enough
When Christmas comes
When Christmas comes
But baby if you spread love
Someday it might be enough
To heal each other
One by one

And we gonna get together and rejoice and pray
And we gonna help the world become a better place
And we gonna sing and shout because the savior reigns
So don't dismay

Because this gift of love, lasts forever
The Lord makes our hearts open up

[Verse 1]
Ooh, hmm, oh yeah
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
And tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight, night

[Chorus]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Verse 3]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two, ooh yeah
Though its been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you, ooh oh yeah, ooh oh yeah

[Chorus]
They know that Santa's on his way, he's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Verse 4]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two, yeah oh
Although its been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, yeah
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah ooh
Oh yeah to you
(Hum, hum, hum...)
Merry Christmas...

[Outro]
Merry Christmas




[Chorus]
I stopped believing in Santa when you said, "Goodbye, love"
Was watching the snow fall
When you called to say we were through
Now whenever I hear those Christmas songs, I just cry loud
So no, I'm not giving your presents to somebody new
'Cause there's no mistletoe, I kicked down the tree
'Cause right now, that don't mean nothing to me
Why can't December just be over real, real soon?
Because Christmas isn't Christmas without you

[Verse]
I stopped believing in Santa when you said, "Goodbye, love"
I can fake it, but they said good Saint Nick is honest to me
No lying, I swear I've been so good all year, what the fuck? (I'm not lying; swear)
So I thought I'd be getting everything that I need (Everything that I need)
Instead I got pain wrapped in heartbreak
No jingle bells, no Santa's sleigh
Why can't December just be over real, real soon? (Over real, real soon)
Because Christmas isn't Christmas without you

[Bridge]
(Fa, la, la, Fa, la, la, la)
Since you went away
(Fa, la, la, Fa, la, la, la)
Since you went away
(Fa, la, la, Fa, la, la, la)
Since you went away

[Chorus]
I stopped believing in Santa when you said, "Goodbye, love"
Was watching the snow fall
When you called to say we were through
Now whenever I hear those Christmas songs, I just cry loud
So no, I'm not giving your presents to somebody new, oh
'Cause there's no mistletoe, I kicked down the tree
'Cause right now, that don't mean nothing to me
Why can't December just be over real, real soon?
Instead I got pain wrapped in heartbreak
No jingle bells on Christmas day
Why can't December just be over real, real soon?
Because Christmas isn't Christmas without you, you, you

[Outro]
I stopped believing in Santa when you said, "Goodbye, love"




[Verse 1]
Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 2]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more nights on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams, mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep




All through the year we've waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
And winter time bringing the happiest season of all

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos, oh

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways, merry Christmas to you

And so we're offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways, merry Christmas merry Christmas, merry Christmas to you




Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
We're walking in a winter wonderland

And gone away (gone away) is the bluebird (is the bluebird)
But here to stay stay stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
We're walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on (later on! ), we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire, babe
We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

And later on (later on! ), we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland
(Walking in a winter wonderland.)




[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really, I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say, no, no, no sir
Oh, mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby, don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, no, no
Aw baby, it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh, your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh, your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby, you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see, no, no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

Sweetly swinging o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

We waited all through the year
For the day to appear
When we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

Please tell me Christmas will never go away




[Verse 1]
Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, it just said this
I know exactly what I want this year
Santa, can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Verse 2]
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're coming to town
Santa, can you hear me?
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh, please make my wish come true
Santa, can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I want my baby, baby (oh)
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
We'll be all the love under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Bridge]
I hope my letter reaches you in time, oh yeah
Bring me love I can call all mine, oh yeah yeah

Can't be alone under the mistletoe
He's all I want in a big red bow

[Outro]
Santa, that's my only wish this year




[Verse 1]
It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

[Verse 2]
Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No, no, no, downtown)
Even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out
Ain't no ice or no chills
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

[Bridge]
Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey




The mood is right

And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes

Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding
Ooh, ooh
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo doo-doo

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong

The party's on
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

[Verse 1]
Dear Santa, it's me, Ariana
I know it's been awhile but I really need your help this year
Let me make this clear
See I, I really love him and it's been kinda tough
Cause he's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flying away, away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need another gift, I just have one wish
This year can you...

[Chorus]
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California

[Verse 2]
Dear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away
See I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days
Can't you make his five o'clock flight delay?
Won't you find a way?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need another gift, I just have one wish, oh yeah
This year can you...

[Chorus]
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California

[Bridge]
I know I'm asking for the impossible, but I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me, so please, please

[Chorus]
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California

[Verse 1]
There is something special
About this time of year
A Christmas feeling's everywhere

I've been away too long (been away too long)
But now I'm back
To share my love
Friends are reunited
One big family
Filled with love
To last throughout the year

Yes, it's Christmas time (oh, Christmas time)

Loving kissing (straight from the heart)
Straight from the heart
Snowflakes falling gently
A smell of chestnuts in the air
And Christmas lights
They gleam across the sky, oh, it's Christmas time

Ho, ho, ho

Shake up the happiness
Wake up the happiness
Shake up the happiness
It's Christmas time

There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it, so let's December it
And reassemble it, oh yeah

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all, it's Christmas time

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all, it's Christmas time

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
It's Christmas time

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above

Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest of the people
Of the east and the west?
And maybe every once in a while
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile

It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a boy one day
That wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all, it's Christmas time

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all, it's Christmas time

I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been

I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow
When they believe again

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all, it's Christmas time

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on y'all, it's Christmas time

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
It's Christmas time
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
(ho-ho-ho ho-ho-ho)
Come on y'all, it's Christmas time
(Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho)

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
(Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho)
Come on y'all, it's Christmas time

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho




Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the night, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song, a song, high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child, a child, shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere
Listen to what I say
A child, a child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light




[Verse 1]
Rocking around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
A mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas tree

Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Chorus]
And you will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rocking around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Deck the halls with boughs of holly

And such happiness in the coming year
(Happiness in the coming year)
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

Whoa
That's what Christmas means to me my love

[Verse]
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peak
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep

[Chorus]
Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
What a laugh it would have been
If daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
(Woo!)

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo

When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Chorus 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten, it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Verse]
Pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that'll make them ring is the carol that you'll sing
Right within your heart

[Chorus 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
And the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So, it's Christmas once more




[Verse 1]
Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

[Refrain]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

[Refrain]
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Oh, Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights, keep shining on




[Verse 1]
Oh Mr Kringle, I'm soon gonna jingle
The bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everyone's waiting for the man with the bag
Cause Christmas is coming again

He's got a sleighful, it's not gonna stay full
He's got stuff to drop at every stop on the way
Everyone's waiting for the man with the bag
Cause Christmas is coming again

He'll be here with the answers to the prayers
That you made through the year
You'll get yours if you've done
Everything you should, extra special good

He'll make this December one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again

[Verse 2]
Oh Mr Cringle, I'm soon gonna jingle
The bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again

He's got a sleighful and it's not gonna stay full
He's got stuff to drop at every stop on the way
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again

He'll be here with the answers to the prayers
That you made through the year
You'll get yours if you've done
Everything you should, extra special good

He'll make this December the one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waiting, they're all congregating
Waiting for the man with the bag, waiting for the man with the bag

[Outro]
Merry Christmas




[Verse 1]
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

[Verse 2]
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

[Verse 3]
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

[Bridge]
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

[Interlude]
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

[Bridge]
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

[Verse 1]
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

[Bridge]
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad




[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm dreaming of a Christmas I used to know
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May your days be merry and bright
And all your Christmases be white




[Intro]
Oh, Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa

[Verse 1]
Santa
If you get this letter
Won't you help me out?
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I sleep on Christmas eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside
And I just can't take it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night

[Chorus]
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night

[Verse 2]
Oh Santa
I heard that it's really gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
’Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, oh Kris Kringle, send me help

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night?

[Chorus]
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa
Come on, Santa

[Refrain]
Oh Santa
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make him mine, mine

[Verse 3]
Oh, Santa Claus
If you get this letter, please don't make me wait
'Cause all December I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?

[Chorus]
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
Santa gon' come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make you




[Verse 1]
Stockings are hung with care
As children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now, but not done hoping

[Verse 2]
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board, so please be careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Verse 3]
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
So cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Bridge]
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours

[Chorus]
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe, tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night

[Closing]
Call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking
Call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours

Make the Yuletide gay
From now on your troubles will be miles away, oh

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore, ah
Faithful friends who are dear to us
They gather near to us once more, ooh

[Chorus]
Through the years we all will be together and
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough, oh yeah, oh
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Faithful friends who are dear to us
They gather near to us once more, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Through the years we all will be together and
If the fates allow, oh yeah
But till then we'll have to muddle through somehow, oh yeah, oh, oh
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now, ooh yeah, oh, ooh

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

Winter's on the wind
Sings familiar melodies
Chill starts setting in
Silver bells are casting spells
It all comes back again
Lay your troubles down
Let me hold you

Now all the signs appear
The Christmas trees, the memories
They bring this time of year
Ghosts of winters past
Come in and whisper in your ear
Don't listen to a word they've told you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

It's only you and me
The world outside is frozen white
I know it's hard to see
I'll be your candle
Be your light
Be anything you need
Star above the night to guide you

To find the highest bow
Hang up your regrets and
Let them fade into the sound
The angel choirs and roaring fires
Magic lost and found
Love is all around
Let it find you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

Through the frightful weather
I will hold you tight
We'll stay warm together
This December night
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
Now I know you've faced the cold alone before
But you don't have to face the cold alone no more
Because I'll keep you warm...




Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have a wish to make
A special one for you

Merry Christmas Darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmasing with you
Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But everyday's a holiday
When I'm near to you
Oh the lights I wish you could see
I wish it every day

Logs on the fire fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas Darling)
Happy New Year too
I have just one wish on this Christmas Eve (On this Christmas Eve)
I wish I were with you

[Instrumental Break]

Logs on the fire fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas darling)
Happy New Year too
I have just one wish on this Christmas Eve (On this Christmas Eve)
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you
(Merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, darling)




[Verse 1]
It's almost midnight, where you lay your head
But I'm calling numbers, buying plane tickets and bed
Every channel on the TV, it's a wonderful life
I don't feel so wonderful on this cold winter night

[Chorus]
I missed Thanksgiving, missed a birthday or two
Didn't make St. Valentines, but I was thinking of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me, Christmas without you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, the snow is on the ground
The day's getting colder, I'm coming home now
So go ahead light the fire, turn that Christmas tree on
Because I've been missing you so much, that I wrote you this song
Yes, I did

[Chorus]
I missed Thanksgiving, missed a birthday or two
Didn't make St. Valentines, but I was thinking of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me, Christmas without you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me, Christmas without you

[Bridge]
Oh, the presents wrapped, and 'Jingle Bells' on the radio
I'm turning down the street, there's no place I'd rather go
Every holiday, oh, you feel the same
Except for the ones when I'm with you

[Chorus]
I missed Thanksgiving, I missed a birthday or two
I didn't make St. Valentines, but I was thinking of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
It's only one thing that kills me, Christmas without you




[Verse 1: Shania Twain]
Spill all your emotions on the table
And let me see your heart upon your sleeve
Open up your soul, I wanna know exactly what you need
Say all you want for Christmas is me

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
I know that I got this thing upon me
I don't need more expensive nonessential things
Cause when I kiss your lips, the feels I get, is everything I need
So tell me all you want for Christmas is me

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Shania Twain]
So I'm gonna love you like, like it's always Christmas Eve
I'm gonna sacrifice the selfish part of me
Cause when we're all alone and I hold you close
It's everything I need
Say all you want for Christmas is me

[Verse 3: Nick Jonas & Shania Twain]
This time of year we always get distracted
Trying to fill up all the space under the tree
So lets take 'em back and know exactly what we really need
Say all you want for Christmas is me

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Shania Twain]
So I'm gonna love you like, like it's always Christmas Eve
I'm gonna sacrifice the selfish part of me
Cause when we're all alone and I hold you close
It's everything I need
Say all you want for Christmas is me

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Shania Twain]
You don't need to worry baby
Cause I'm right here by you
And everyday would drive me crazy if I lost you

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Shania Twain]
So I'm gonna love you like it's always Christmas Eve
I'm gonna sacrifice the selfish part of me
Cause when we're all alone and I hold you close
It's everything I need
Say all you want for Christmas
Say all you want for Christmas
Say all you want for Christmas
Say all you want is me




[Verse 1]
Santa Baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl, santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Baby a 54 convertible too light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the Fella's that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check out my Christmas list

[Verse 2]
Santa Baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Honey, one little thing I really need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a duplex and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line, Santa cutie
And hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

[Verse 3]
Santa Baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring - I don't mean on the phone, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonight




[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose, yeah
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Usher & Justin Bieber]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly, yeah

[Chorus: Usher & Justin Bieber]
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Yeah and so, I'm offering this simple phrase, oh woah
To kids from one to ninety-two, yeah yeah
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas yeah, Merry Christmas oh no, Merry Christmas to you




Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Just walking, talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland




Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you




Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

[Instrumental]

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year




T's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the Five and Ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart, right within your heart




Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the snow!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
But, my dear, we're still goodbying
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the snow!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow...!
Ouw!




Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the earth
The Saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

He rules the earth
With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousnes
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders, and wonders of his love




Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned away down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still good-bying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of year
Snowflakes in the air, yeah
Carols everywhere, oh
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share
Sleigh bells in the air
And beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year

Yeah, Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing so near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Oh, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate, yea
It's Christmas time, yeah
Mmm, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, oh oh oh it's Christmas time right now
It's here, it's here celebrate, celebrate, celebrate




Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away you roam
When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home

I met a man who lives in Tennessee
And he was headin' for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
From Pennsylvania folks are trav'lin' down
To Dixie's sunny shore
From Atlantic to Pacific, gee
The traffic is teriffic!

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away you roam
When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home

When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home
Holidays you can't beat home
Holidays you can't beat home,sweet home




[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"




I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry?
Father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no sir - Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside

I simply must go - But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no - But baby it's cold outside
This welcome has been - How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out that window, at that storm

My sister will be suspicious - God, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon the tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Ooh your lips are delicious
Well, maybe, just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before

I got to get home - But baby, you'd freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand
Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
Oh, baby, it's cold outside
Oh, baby, it's cold outside

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
They won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

(I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin')
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents
Countrysides covered with snow
Oh, by gosh, by jingle
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle
Overeating, merry greetings
From relatives you don't know
Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a Yuletide hymn
Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Fancy ties an' granny's pies
An' folks stealin' a kiss or two
As they whisper, "Merry Christmas" to you
Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a Yuletide hymn
Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Fancy ties an' granny's pies
An' folks stealin' a kiss or two
As they whisper, "Merry Christmas" to you




Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Verse 1]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer?
Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

[Chorus]
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell you
That old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock-'n'-rolling with the rest

[Chorus]
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Sigue]
What will your daddy do when he sees your momma kissing Santa Claus?

[Verse 2]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you've been slayed

[Chorus]
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
(It's only just begun)

So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
(Everybody's having fun)
Look to the future now
It's only just begun




Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years
We all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

(Rudolph)
(Rudolph)

[Chorus]
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games

Then, one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

Then, how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

[Bridge]
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer

And if you ever saw it

Then, one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph mit your nose so bright
Won't you guide mein sleigh tonight?"

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the Red-Beaked Reindeer
You'll go down in history

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring, ting, tingling, too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you




Frosty, the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal
Frosty, the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow but the children know
That he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Oh Frosty, the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Thumpetty, thump, thump, thumpety, thump, thump
Look at Frosty go, thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump, over the hills of snow
Frosty, the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now, before I melt away"
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there, all around the square
Sayin', "Catch me if you can"
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, "Stop"
Because ol' Frosty, the snowman, he had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin', "Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day, I'll be back again some day
I'll be back again some day"




O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born

O night divine
O night
O night divine

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born

O night divine
O night
O night divine




[Verse 1]
Stockings are hung with care
As children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now, but not done hoping

[Verse 2]
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board, so please be careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Verse 3]
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
So cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Bridge]
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours

[Chorus]
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe, tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night

[Closing]
Call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking
Call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours




[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 1]
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
No, I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
There upon the fireplace
Cause Santa he won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day


[Hook]
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Girl, what can I do?
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 2]
And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
Won't you please bring my baby to me...

[Chorus]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
No, I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
More that you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...
Is you...




Come along, follow me
Let me take you to Christmasland
It’s a place very near
Where you find your own wonderland
Waiting there for you
You will see all the friends you knew
Santa Claus will be there
There’ll be toys and some mistletoe
All the things that you loved as a child
Many years ago
Come and take my hand
We’ll find happiness
Let’s go to Christmasland
Come and take my hand
We’ll go, you and I
To find our Christmasland




Santa baby, slip a Rolex under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good guy
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa buddy, a '65 convertible too, steel blue
I'll wait up for you dude
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the hotties that I never kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'd check off my Christmas list

Santa pally, I wanna yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an sweetie all year
Santa buddy, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa buddy, one thing that I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa pally, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa buddy, fill my stocking with Canucks tix, for kicks
Throw me on the first line
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Mercedes
I really I do believe in you
Now let's see if you believe in me

Santa poppy, forgot to mention one little thing, cha-ching
No I don't mean as a loan
Santa buddy, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Oh hurry down the chimney tonight




Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun




I'm dreamin' tonight of a place I love
Even more then I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light beams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light beams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams




[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away

[Bridge]
Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more

[Verse 3]
Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now




I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days
Be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days
Be merry and bright
May all your Christmas' be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white




City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Strings of streetlights even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Silver bells, silver bells
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Soon it will be Christmas Day

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Bridge]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Verse 2]
So, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
“Merry Christmas to you”

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
So, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
“Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you”*




I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the north pole to spend a holiday

I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Then kids in Girl and Boyland will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy-land all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town




Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heav'nly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, loves pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth




Snowfall
Softly
Gently drift down

Snowflakes
Whisper
'Neath my window

Covering trees
Misty lights
Velvet breeze
'Round my doorstep

Gently
Softly
Silent
Snowfall

Snowfall




Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flock by night
And see a bright new shining star
And hear a choir sing
The music seem to come from afar

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
And find no place to borne she child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
(Christmas)
The snow's coming down
(Christmas)
I'm watching it fall
(Christmas)
Lots of people around
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
The church bells in town
(Christmas)
All ringing in song
(Christmas)
Full of happy sounds
(Christmas)
Baby please come home

[Chorus]
They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

[Verse 2]
(Christmas)
Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas)
I'm watching them shine
(Christmas)
You should be here with me
(Christmas)
Baby please come home

[Chorus]
They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

[Bridge]
(Christmas)
If there was a way
(Christmas)
I'd hold back these tears
(Christmas)
But it's Christmas day

Silent night, holy night!
All is calm, All is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so Tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight!
Glories stream from heaven afar;
Heavenly hosts sing Al-le-lu-ia!
Christ the Savior is born!
Christ the Savior is born!

Silent night, holy night!
Wondrous star, lend thy light!
With the angels let us sing
Alleluia to our King!
Christ the Savior is here
Jesus the Savior is here!

Silent night, Holy night!
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth;
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Sing sweet and low a lullaby, till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem
While wisemen follow through the dark, a star that beckons them
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem

A little child shall lead them, the prophets said of old
Through storm and tempest heed them until the bell is tolled
Sing sweet and low your lullaby, till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem

Sing sweet and low your lullaby till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem




Come they told me
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
A new born king to see
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum

Peace on earth, can it be
Years from now, perhaps we'll see
See the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace, live in peace again

Peace on earth, can it be

Every child must be made aware
Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can

I pray my wish will come true
For my child and your child too
He'll see the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace, live in peace again

Peace on earth, can it be
Can it be

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The babe, the son of Mary
Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding
Good Christian fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The babe, the son of Mary




The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing
But I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember a worst December
Just you watch those icicles fall
What do I care if those icicles fall
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat, off with my glove
Who needs an overcoat I'm burning with love

My heart's on fire and the fire gets higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm




Come, they told me pa-rum pum pum pum
Our newborn King to see, pa-rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring pa-rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King pa-rum pum pum pum

So to honor Him pa-rum pum pum pum

Shall I play for you, pa-rum pum pum pum
On my drum?

Mary nodded pa-rum pum pum pum

[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)




[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

And one day your love came down to me
And it turned around what I believe
Now all that I know on Christmas Day

You'll get what you give, take that from me
And somewhere I know a miracle longs to be
Between you and me

Let love be love, let life be life

Let love be love, let life be life (Let love be love)

I would've made our love eternally
Let love be love, let life be life (Let love be love)
Every song that we sing gonna come out right
Even if the stars fell down on me (Let love be love)
I would've made our love eternally




[Verse 1]
Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, it just said this
I know exactly what I want this year
Santa, can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Verse 2]
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're coming to town
Santa, can you hear me?
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh, please make my wish come true
Santa, can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I want my baby, baby (oh)
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
We'll be all the love under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Bridge]
I hope my letter reaches you in time, oh yeah
Bring me love I can call all mine, oh yeah yeah
'Cause I have been so good, so good this year
Can't be alone under the mistletoe
He's all I want in a big red bow

[Chorus]
Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here, oh yeah
Santa, that's my only wish this year (ah)
Oh, Santa! (ah)
Can you hear me? (ah)
Oh, Santa (ah)
Well, he's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here, oh yeah
Santa, that's my only wish this year

[Outro]
Santa, that's my only wish this year




[Vers 1: Julie Berthelsen]
På hendes pude står tanker i kø
Lagt i jord som blomsterfrø
Skyder og spirer og snor sig omkring
Hun forstår slet ingenting

[Bro: Martin Brygmann]
Timer føles som dage
Og uger tusind år
Kom til at se sig tilbage
Til en verden af i går

[Omkvæd: Julie Berthelsen & Martin Brygmann]
Jesus og Josefine
Hjemløse hjertepine
Men Jesus får Josefine
Til at tro på mirakler, når hun vakler

[Vers 2: Julie Berthelsen]
Hyrder og engle og tre vise mænd
Skæbnen vil hun ska' derhen
Møder en konge, en frelser, en fyr
Julen bli'r et eventyr

[Bro: Martin Brygmann]
Timer føles som dage
Og uger tusind år
Kom til at se sig tilbage
Til en verden af i går

[Omkvæd: Julie Berthelsen & Martin Brygmann]
Jesus og Josefine
Hjemløse hjertepine
Men Jesus får Josefine
Til at tro på mirakler
Jesus og Josefine
Troløse tidsmaskine
Fristerens konkubine
Hun får brug for mirakler, når hun vakler

[Kontraststykke: Julie Berthelsen & Martin Brygmann]
To sjæle flyver stille
I den dunkle nat
De hører mørkets trille
Fra den sorte kat

[Omkvæd: Julie Berthelsen & Martin Brygmann]
(Jesus og Josefine
Hjemløse hjertepine)
Jesus og Josefine
Hjemløse hjertepine
Men Jesus får Josefine
Til at tro på mirakler (Tro på kærlighed)
Jesus og Josefine
Troløse tidsmaskine
Fristerens konkubine
Hun for brug for mirakler (Brug for kærlighed)
Når hun vakler




[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So it's Christmas once more




Christmas coming around again eh?
Yeah I mean it must be nearly a year since the last one
Oh it's a good twelve months
Yeah yeah
You getting anything for your Granny this year?
Well I thought about it I couldn't be bothered
Well it's the thought that counts innit
Yeah that's how I see it
What do you fancy for Christmas then
Kim Wilde as usual, kidding myself though arent't I
It's hopeless really it's pathetic I suppose in a way
It is yeah - hello who is this?
Merry Christmas Melvyn
It can't be
Come on Mel how about pulling a cracker
By the look of you darling I think I already have
Get it

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple try to stop
Come on Melly-pops

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
Pumpkin pie anyone?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
This is so corny
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Wow I am in the most almighty Christmas groove
I haven't had this much fun
Since "Two little boys" was number one
If my friends could see me now
How do I look?
Ridiculous
You little tease
A dance, Kimberley?

I do love a nice sax break
Yeah me too Kim, but let's wait till the record's over
Kim do you think our love will last forever?
No
Couple of years maybe?
No
Do you think we'll make it to the end of the record?
How long is that - exactly?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
All together now
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Excuse me can I sing something now?
Get lost Griff!
Well that's nice...

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Root beer anyone?
Later we'll have pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolling
There's plenty of pumpkin pie left by the way
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Do you mind Melvyn?
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Wow yeah that was fantastic
Very nice
Let's do it again! One two three four...
Strewth
Five!

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
He overdid it with the pumpkin pie
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Merry Christmas everybody!
Merry Christmas everybody!
Bye Mel it's been really interesting
I'll tell you who I fancy for Christmas
Who's that
Bananarama
Yeah can't help you there I'm afraid
Oh thanks a bundle!




[Vers 1: Burhan G]
Tinka, vågn' op - du sover, min ven
Der' brug for din styrke, det' jul nu igen

[Bro: Frida Brygmann]
Du har øjnene fulde, fuld' af eventyr
Men miraklernes tid er forbi

[Omkvæd: Burhan G & Frida Brygmann]
Tinka, du drømmer, tror du vi ka'
Finde tilbage til magien?
Tinka, du drømmer, ka' menneskers land
Forenes med nissernes rige?
Tinka, vågn op

[Vers 2: Burhan G]
Tinka, pas på - stol på dig selv
Du klarer dig med hjertet, mod og lidt held

[Bro: Frida Brygmann]
Du har øjnene fulde, fuld' af eventyr
Men miraklernes tid er forbi

[Omkvæd: Burhan G & Frida Brygmann]
Tinka, du drømmer, tror du vi ka'
Finde tilbage til magien?
Tinka, du drømmer, ka' menneskers land
Forenes med nissernes rige?

[Kontraststykke: Frida Brygmann & Burhan G]
Kun dem der tør at være sig selv
De bli'r til noget, noget helt specielt
Selv her i nissernes rige
Hvis Tinka tør at være sig selv
Ku' vi måske alligevel
Mødes i nissernes rige

[Vers 3: Frida Brygmann]
Tinka, du har truffet dit valg
Din rejse den ændrer på dig

[Omkvæd: Burhan G & Frida Brygmann]
Tinka, du drømmer (Tinka, du drømmer) tror du vi ka'
Finde tilbage til magien? (Finde tilbage til magien, ka' vi?)
Tinka, du drømmer, ka' menneskers land
Forenes med nissernes rige?

[Kontraststykke: Frida Brygmann & Burhan G]
Kun dem der tør at være sig selv
De bli'r til noget, noget helt specielt
Selv her i nissernes rige
Hvis Tinka tør at være sig selv
Ku' vi måske alligevel
Mødes i nissernes rige

[Outro: Frida Brygmann]
Tror du vi ka'
Finde tilbage til magien?




Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock




[Vers 1]
Miraklerne kommer, når vi er klar
Klar til at glemme os selv
Drømmer vi nu, eller glemmer vi blot, at vi—
—vakler alene, men sammen står—
Sammen står vi stærkere når—
—at det, man kan tro på men ikke helt forstå
Viser vej
For dig og mig

[Omkvæd]
Mens vi går gennem gaderne
Så ved vi, alt kan ske
Vi bryder barrikaderne
I en stjerneregn af sne
Og juleaften nærmer sig
Mens natten den bli'r lang
Mon lysetsengel viser sig
Og reder os fra undergang?

[Vers 2]
Orakler, profeter og visemænd
Findes de stadig endnu?
Et barns fantasi er en verden af sand magi
Vi vakler alene, men sammen står—
Sammen står vi stærkere når—
—at det, man kan tro på men ikke helt forstå
Viser vej
For dig og mig

[Omkvæd]
Mens vi går gennem gaderne
Så ved, vi alt kan ske
Vi bryder barrikaderne
I en stjerneregn af sne
Og juleaften nærmer sig
Mens natten den bli'r lang
Mon lysetsengel viser sig
Og reder os fra undergang?

[Kontraststykke]
Julefreden sænkes stille over by
Mens vi venter på et tegn
Barnet sover trygt i lysetsengels favn
Vågner op til gaveregn

[Omkvæd]
Mens vi går gennem gaderne
Så ved, vi alt kan ske
Vi bryder barrikaderne
I en stjerneregn af sne
Og juleaften nærmer sig
Mens natten den bli'r lang
Mon lysetsengel viser sig
Og reder os fra undergang?

[Outro]
I en stjerneregn, en stjerneregn af sne

[Vers 1]
Du ramte mig med din pil og bue midt i juletid, yeah
Du gør det godt i din nissehue, og du ved det
Hvis du ikk' har planer med nogen, så la' os start' en tradition
Det kræver kun, at vi er to (Na-na-na-na)

Altid held i spil og held pakkeleg

Kom baby, drop din sweater

I'm driving home for Christmas
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Well, I'm moving down that line

And it's been so long
But I will be there
I sing this song
To pass the time away

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

It's gonna take some time but I'll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me

Driving in my car
I'm driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
Just the same

Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
Oh and feel you near me

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
He's driving home, driving home
Driving home for Christmas

Driving home for Christmas




[Vers 1]
Det' den generation der ik' vil love hinanden noget
Si'r vi tror på kærlighed men vil alligevel ikke stå på tå
Vi har danset rundt om den varme grød alt for længe
Alt for længe nu, uh-uh

[Omkvæd]
Ja, jeg ved godt at jeg har sagt jeg ikk' var klar
Men der' noget i december
Der ligesom minder mig om hva' der virkelig gælder
Jeg var ung og naiv men man bli'r ældre og forstår
Tiden går, hjerter slår
Det' som om i december
Bli'r det svært at forstå hvorfor vi to venter
Inderst inde ved jeg jo du' den jeg elsker, jeg forstår
Tiden går, hjerter slår i december

[Vers 2]
Vi den generation der kan have flere tusind venner
Og tro at vi ka' få kærlighed ogs' for dem vi ikk' rigtig kender
Ja, jeg blev glad da du sendte det billede op foran pejsen
Men jeg vil meget hellere have været der selv, IRL

[Omkvæd]
Ja, jeg ved godt at jeg har sagt jeg ikk' var klar
Men der' noget i december
Der ligesom minder mig om hva' der virkelig gælder
Jeg var ung og naiv men man bli'r ældre og forstår
Tiden går, hjerter slår
Det' som om i december
Bli'r det svært at forstå hvorfor vi to venter
Inderst inde ved jeg jo du' den jeg elsker, jeg forstår
Tiden går, hjerter slår i december

[Kontraststykke]
Et liv vi har, et liv er det
Ikk' spild af tid hvis vi ikk' spilder den tid med hinanden
Sig mig, hvad det egentlig er vi går og venter på
Svært at forstå i december
Man bli'r ældre og forstår
Tiden går, hjerter slår

[Omkvæd]
Det' som om i december
Bli'r det svært at forstå hvorfor vi to venter
Inderst inde ved jeg jo du' den jeg elsker, jeg forstår
Tiden går, hjerter slår i december




[Omkvæd]
Drømte mig en drøm i nat
Om julesang og julepjat
Om engle falder ned fra sky
En julenat i indre by
Julesneen falder nu
Det sku' den helst ved juletid
En englesang med fryd derom
Jeg drømte mig en lille drøm

[Vers 1]
Nu' det blevet jul igen
Og julemanden er din ven
Har du været sød i år
De slemme børn ingen gaver får
Og hvis du gemmer på noget i dit hjerte, min ven
Så ønsk det nu, for du ka' aldrig bli' et barn igen

[Omkvæd]
Drømte mig en drøm i nat
Om julesang og julepjat
Engle falder ned fra sky
En julenat i indre by
Julesneen falder nu
Det sku' den helst ved juletid
En englesang med fryd derom
Jeg drømte mig en lille drøm

[Instrumental solo]

[Vers 2]
Der sker ting, som ikk' sku' ske
Men er det sket, så er det det
Er der noget du ikke fik gjort?
Så gør det nu, livet er så kort
Og hvis du har et ønske i dit hjerte, min ven
Ja, så ønsk det nu, for du ka' ikk' gå tilbage igen

[Omkvæd]
Drømte mig en drøm i nat
Om julesang og julepjat
Om engle falder ned fra sky
En julenat i indre by
Julesneen falder nu
Det sku' den helst ved juletid
En englesang med fryd derom
Jeg drømte mig en lille drøm

[Vers 3]
Er der noget du ikke fik gjort?
Så gør det nu
For livet er så kort
Der er så mange gaver
Der skal gi'es bort

[Omkvæd]
Julesneen falder ned (er der noget)
Det sku' den helst ved juletid (du ikk' fik gjort?)
Engelsang med fryd derom (ikk' fik gjort?)
Jeg drømte mig en lille drøm

[Omkvæd]
Drømte mig en drøm i nat
Om julesang og julepjat
Om engle falder ned fra sky
En julenat i indre by

Nu er det jul igen på D'Angleterre
Vi holder julefest og spiser flæskesvær
Nu er det jul igen, og vi spiser juleand
Danser om juletræ, og jeg er julemand, uh yeah

[Vers 1]
Et barn er født i guld langt væk fra Bethlehem
Og baby, du har været slem
Men vi' cool igen, for det' jul igen
Sæt dig på mit skød, og smag på min julegrød
Den er så god og sød ligesom dig, uh-hu

For jeg, jeg har en gave til dig

Jeg ved godt, det er koldt, når sneen den falder på dig (iskoldt)
Baby, bare gi' mig din hånd
Kom, kom, kom i kanen med mig
Vi ku' flyve til julebal nede i nisseland
Remee er en nissemand
Jeg vil ha' hans nissekone (iskoldt)

[Bro]
Og jeg, jeg har en gave til dig
Og du pakker den ud, gaven er mig

[Omkvæd]
Det' jul igen, det' jul igen
Sneen den falder på dig

Det' jul igen, det' jul igen
Og sneen den falder på mig

[Kontraststykke]
Nej, det' ikke sandt, nej, det ikk' sandt
Det' ikk' sandt
At julen varer til påske, nu må I forstå det, uh
Det' ikke sandt, nej, det' ikk' sandt
Det' ikk' sandt
At julen varer til påske, nu må I forstå det, åh

[Omkvæd]
Det' jul igen, det' jul igen
Sneen den falder på dig
Det' jul igen, og vi er cool igen, åh-uh, uh-ja
Nummer ét igen, nummer ét igen
Og sneen den falder på mig

Ja, det' jul igen, jeg deler gaver ud
Og flyver rundt på Rudolf med den røde tud




[Verse 1]
Santa Baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl, santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Baby a 54 convertible too light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the Fella's that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check out my Christmas list

[Verse 2]
Santa Baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Honey, one little thing I really need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a duplex and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line, Santa cutie
And hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

[Verse 3]
Santa Baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring - I don't mean on the phone, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonight




[Vers 1: Thomas Helmig & Søs Fenger]
Sneen falder som krystaller
På julemænd og på damer
Og vinden fyger uendelig storm
Af tilbud og reklamer
Guirlander og blålys og bjælder
Og lys i barnlige øjne
Og Fanden selv står i TV og sælger
De sidste nye løgne

[Omkvæd: Thomas Helmig & Søs Fenger]
Så er det jul igen
Så er det jul igen
For julebørn og julemænd

[Vers 2: Thomas Helmig, Søs Fenger & begge]
Og de synger i radio'n ved fem-tid'n
En lille sang om et håb
Der rækker helt fra Herodes til fremtid'n
Et kærlighedens råb
Et fremmed barn alene i mørket
Et fremmed land uden lys
Så rækker du din hånd ud af mørket
Og pluds'lig er der lys

[Omkvæd: Thomas Helmig & Søs Fenger]
Så er det jul igen
Så er det jul igen
For julebørn og julemænd

[Vers 3: Thomas Helmig]
Og hva' du ønsker, det ska' du få
I julegave at tygge på
Og dem der prædiker kævl og splid
Ska' få kævl til evig tid, ja

[Vers 4: Søs Fenger]
Så rækker du din hånd ud af mørket
Og pludselig er der lys

[Omkvæd: Thomas Helmig & Søs Fenger]
Så er det jul igen
Så er det jul igen
For julebørn og julemænd
Så er det jul igen
Så er det jul igen
For julebørn og julemænd

[Outro: Thomas Helmig & Søs Fenger]
Så er det jul igen
Så er det jul igen




Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år er på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Nu da den første sne
Igen
Er væk
Er det mer' på vej
Meget snart
Den smelted' i takt med
Så meget andet
Når solen skinner
Bliver alting klar
Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Blanke krystaller der
Hvor sneen den lå
Bringer minder frem
Mens hjerterne slår
Der' altid så meget
At lave om på
Men stjernen på himlen
Den består
Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Bomberne finder vej
I dag
Og i nat
Mens vi tænder lys (mens vi tænder lys)
I mørket fordi (i mørket fordi)
Vi håber og tror på
Et nyt år tusind
Hvor mennesker lever
Helt uden krig
Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får
Når julen er forbi
Og et nyt år på vej
Vil vi prøve at nå
Det vi drømte om i år
Og vi lover hinanden
For en aller sidste gang
At huske at leve og bruge hvert sekundt vi får




Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow




[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 1]
Tonight, I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]
But then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 2]
I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Saxophone Solo]

[Bridge]
And then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree, yeah

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need)
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (Underneath the tree)
You're all that I need (Underneath the tree, yeah)
Underneath the tree, tonight
Oh, you're all I need
Underneath, underneath the tree




[Verse 1]
Oh, my love, we've had our share of tears
Oh, my friend, we've had our hopes and fears
Oh, my friends, it's been a long hard year

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas

[Verse 2]
The moon and stars seem awful cold and bright
Let's hope the snow will make this Christmas right
My friend, the world will share this special night

[Pre-Chorus]
Because it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one night

[Chorus]
Thank God it's Christmas, yeah
Thank God it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Can it be Christmas?
Let it be Christmas
Every day

[Verse 3]
Oh, my love, we live in troubled days
Oh, my friend, we have the strangest ways
All my friends on this one day of days
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one day

[Outro]
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Ooh yeah
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes, yes, yes, yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one day
A very merry Christmas to you all




You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice;
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Cause Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
And he knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
I mean a big fat man with a long white beard
He's coming to town




[Vers 1]
Work, work and work the hele daug
Work work and work there's nok to lave
No food, no hvil, no noget som helst
I think it is a little trælst

Nogen kan ha' free when it is jul
Free både from arbejde and from school
But when you are a nissemand
That's simplethen not noget you can

I say: Heey
It's hard to be a nissemand
Yeh-yeah, heey
It's hard to be a nisse
Heey
It's hard to be a nissemand
Yeh-yeh-yeah
It's hard to be a nisse

[Vers 1]
Lille store verden, hvordan ska' det dog gå
Kaos, krig og uvenskab, hvem har du at stole på?
Lille store verden mærker du mon os
En smule ro ved vintertid, et øjeblik hvor vi ikke slås

[Bro]
Selv en fjende ka' bli' en ven
I denne tid hvor man ser verden som et barn igen

[Omkvæd]
Det' det, der er med december
Der får mig til at tro på
Der ka' være håb selv for mennesker
Når vi gør alt for dem, vi elsker
Engle daler ned, og jeg tror
At hvis vi finder fred på vores jord
Åh-åh-åh, så bli'r det nok til jul
Så bli'r det nok til jul

[Vers 2]
Lille store verden, sig mig, gør det ondt?
De bygger, borer, banker løs, kan du stadig dreje rundt?
Lille store verden(verden) får du mon lidt fred (får du mon lidt fred)
For folk de slipper våbnene, og så 'der pludselig sang i gaden

[Bro]
Selv en fjende ka' bli' en ven
I denne tid hvor man ser verden som et barn igen

[Omkvæd]
Uh, det' det, der er med december
Der får mig til at tro på
Der ka' være håb selv for mennesker
Når vi gør alt for dem, vi elsker
Engle daler ned, og jeg tror
At hvis vi finder fred på vores jord
Åh-åh-åh, så bli'r det nok til jul

[Kontraststykke]
Jeg ved jo godt, at det' en ønskedrøm
At det ikk' sker henover natten med en trylleslag
Men alligevel
Jeg tror stadig lidt, bare lidt på magi

[Omkvæd]
Det' det, der er med december
Der får mig til at tro på
Der ka' være håb selv for mennesker
Når vi gør alt for dem, vi elsker
Engle daler ned, og jeg tror
At hvis vi finder fred på vores jord
Åh-åh-åh, så bli'r det nok til jul
(Så bli'r nok, så bli'r det nok, så bli'r det nok til juleaften)
Så bli'r det nok til jul
(Så bli'r nok, så bli'r det nok, så bli'r det nok til juleaften)
Engle daler ned, og jeg tror
At hvis vi finder fred på vores jord
Åh-åh-åh, så bli'r det nok til jul

[Outro]
Lille store verden
Herfra hvor jeg står
Tror jeg kun, det' kærlighed
Du ønsker dig til næste år




Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Just walking, talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland




[Verse 1]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Winter love is spreading everywhere"
Summer came and took off with the Spring
So now we start the Christmas caroling
I'll find my way back home
And light up every tree
We will hang our stockings for you and one for me
Cause Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said "Pack your bags and tell them you'll be there"

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
Home, I'll be home
(I'll be home)

[Verse 2]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Wrap the gifts with all your love and care"
The wind, it blows the snow up in the sky
But I won't let the wind delay my flight

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home
I promise, I promise
I'll be home, I'll be home
(I'll be home)

[Bridge]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Pack your bags and tell him you'll be there"

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas (I'll be home)
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas (I'll be home)
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home, oh
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home




[Intro]
(Happy Christmas, Kyoko
Happy Christmas, Julian)

[Pre-Chorus]
So this is Christmas
And what have you done?
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you had fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

[Chorus]
A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

[Verse 1]
And so this is Christmas (War is over)
For weak and for strong (If you want it)
For rich and the poor ones (War is over)
The road is so long (Now)
And so happy Christmas (War is over)
For black and for white (If you want it)
For yellow and red ones (War is over)
Let's stop all the fight (Now)

[Chorus]
A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

[Pre-Chorus]
And so this is Christmas (War is over)
And what have we done? (If you want it)
Another year over (War is over)
And a new one just begun (Now)
And so happy Christmas (War is over)
We hope you had fun (If you want it)
The near and the dear ones (War is over)
The old and the young (Now)

[Chorus]
A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

[Outro]
War is over, if you want it
War is over, now
Happy Christmas
Happy Christmas, Christmas
Happy Christmas, Christmas




Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on your troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on your troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now




[Vers 1: Simon, Henrik & Kåre]
Så 'det jul - det' tid til gløgg og and
Sneen daler i Angoras land
Jeg ska' hjem og pudse mit klaver, så lyder det godt
Mit talent er nog', der imponerer, ha

Nej, det skal vi ikk'
Vi ska' danse om et træ

[Vers 2: Simon, russere & Bugge & Ronald]
Hvot gul mnji vu Vlad i Gagarin
Hold da kæft, hva' er't I sir' I fe' russersvin? Total perker-agtigt
Simon er en dum, dum, dum, dum én

Styr jer, grydehår og tændstikben
Oorh, Han kaldt' dig for tændstikben

[Vers 1]
Nu' det jul, nu' det jul
Alle nissebande-nisser er så glade
De ska' tømme mange, mange, mange fade
Fyldt med risengrød
Nu' det jul, nu' det jul
Alle nissebande-nisser er så spændte
På hvor mange pakker, de ska' hente
Om pakken den er blød

[Omkvæd]
Højt oppe langt mod nord
Der hvor julemanden bor
Og kigger fra sit vinterskjul
Der står hans kane klar
Til den tur han ta'r
Så det ka bli' en dejlig jul

[Vers 2]
Men hva' nu, men hva' nu
Hvis de ikke kom de pakker, der sku' komme
Og hvis alle fadende var tomme, hva' mon
Der så ku' være sket?
Er han træt? (Er han træt?) Har han grædt?
Er han svag og syg og smittet og forkølet?
Løber næsen ned i nisseøllet?
Eller har han det skidt?

[Omkvæd]
Højt oppe langt mod nord
Der hvor julemanden bor
Og kigger fra sit vinterskjul
Der står hans kane klar
Til den tur han ta'r
Så det ka bli' en dejlig jul

[Outro]
Nu' det jul igen (Nu' det jul igen)
Der står hans kane klar
Til den tur han ta'r
Så det ka bli' en dejlig jul
Så det ka bli' en dejlig jul
Dejlig jul




[Intro]
Det skete i de dage i november engang
At de første kataloger satte hyggen i gang

[Vers 1]
Det' jul, det' cool, det' nu man hygger sig bedst
Det' julebal i Nisseland, familiernes fest
Med fornøjet glimt i øjet, trækker folk i vintertøjet
Til den årlige folkevandring op og ned ad Strøget
Der bli'r handlet, pakket ind, og der bli'r købt og solgt
Tøsne, snot i næsen, det' pisse koldt
Det er vinter, man forventer vel lidt kulde og sne
Men det' da klart at en såd'n sag må komme bag på DSB
Intet vrøvl har de forsvoret, det de helt sikre på
Men ved den første rim på sporet, går møllen i stå
Folk de tripper, skælder ud, og ser på deres ure
Og sparker efter invalide, ynkelige duer
Der er intet, man kan gøre, de sure buschauffører
Gør det svært at praktisere lidt julehumør
"Gå så tilbage for helvede" råber stodderen hæst
Men det' jul, det' cool, det nu man hygger sig bedst

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]

[Vers 2]
Det' jul, det' cool, gran og lirekasser
Der er mænd, der sælger juletræer på alle åbne pladser
12 bevægelige nisser og en sort mekanisk kat
I et vindue ud mod Strøget trækker flere tusind watt
Kulørte gavepakker i kulørte juleposer
Selv i Bilka og i Irma og i alle landets brugser
Er der ægte julestemning og gratis brune kager
Der er hylder fyldt med hygge, der er hygge på lager
Og hoes damerne i Illum kan man få det som man vil
"Kontant eller på konto, hr.? Ska' prisen dækkes til?"
De smiler og er flinke, mest for fruerne i minke
Og gi'r gode råd om alt fra sexet undertøj til sminke
Og vi andre fattigrøve, vi ka' gå i Dalle-Valle
Der er damerne så flinke, at de smiler pænt til alle
Der er masser tøj i kasser, der helt sikkert passer
Det' jul, det' cool, gran og lirekasser

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]

[Vers 3]
Det' jul, det' cool, kig dig lidt omkring
15.000 mennesker i Magasin
De har våde lædersko, de har halstørklæder på
De har overfrakker, gavepakker, masser de ska' nå
Men de hygger sig, sel'fø'lig gør de det
Plastik stjerner, plastik gran og plastik sne
Sætter stemning i systemer, det' så nemt og nul problemer
Køb blot julestuens julesæt med fire fine cremer
Eller sukkerkrukker, pyntedukker, pænt, mondænt og ganske smukt
Søde sæt med proptrækker, glas og øloplukker
Fra en skjult højttalerinstallation
"Et barn er født i Bethlehem" i Hammondorgel-version
Vi' traditionsbundne folk, i traditionernes land
Så vi hygger os, li'så fint vi kan
Og særlig uundværlig, det er Magasin
Det' jul, det' cool, kig dig lidt omkring

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]

[Mellemstykke]
"Højt fra træets grønne top"
"Mød julemanden klokken 13, 15, og 17 på julestuen på 3. sal"
"Vores velassorterede vinafdeling kan tilbyde et komplet gløgg-sæt for kun 39.95"
"Lille Øyvind på fem år er blevet væk fra sin mor, han kan afhentes i kundeservice"

[Vers 4]
"Jamen du godeste er det allerede..."
Jul det' cool sikke tiden den går
Der er intet lavet om siden sidste år
Det' de samme ting vi spiser, det' de samme ting vi laver
De samme ting i TV, de samme julegaver
Samme pengeproblemer, det' dyrt og hårdt
Udelukkende overtrukne kontokort
Overflod og fråds med familie og med venner
Samvittigheden klares med en ulandskalender
Det' julefrokosttid, traditionspilleri
Sprutkørsel, utroskab, og madsvineri
Vi har prøvet det før, vi ved præcis hvad der sker
Slankekur i januar og alt det der
Det' et slid, men der er lang tid til næste år
Det' jul, det' cool, sikke tiden den går

[Instrumentalt omkvæd]
"Jeg drømmer om en hvid sandstrand
Med palmetræer og sommervejr
Der vil jeg fejre julen
I swimmingpoolen
Langt væk fra sne og juletræer"

[DJ solo & outro]




[Vers 1]
Se, der' den nye julemand
Mon han har klejner med?
Han vinker til os fra sit rensdyrspand
Mens han flyver afsted

[Vers 2]
Jesus bli'r født på anden sal
I Magasin du Nord
Han griner, når du trykker på en fodpedal
Si'r goddag til sin mor

[Omkvæd]
Nu' det jul, og træet tændes påny
Nu' det jul i land og by
Og guds engle små klæ'r sig festligt på
I den himmelblå
Nu' det jul, og træet tændes påny
Nu' det jul i land og by
Og guds engle små klæ'r sig festligt på
Og synger i sky

[Vers 3]
Familien er samlet fra nær og fjern
Synet er pyntet med vat
Og udenfor lyser den ledestjerne
I en smuk julenat

[Omkvæd]
Nu' det jul, og træet tændes påny
Nu' det jul i land og by
Og guds engle små klæ'r sig festligt på
I den himmelblå
Nu' det jul, og træet tændes påny
Nu' det jul i land og by
Og guds engle små klæ'r sig festligt på
Og synger i sky




[Vers 1]
Vi har vandret i en evighed
Vi har vendt hver enkelt sten
Kom nu, vis et tegn
Vis mig vejen, jeg har brug dig
Sig det, sig det

[Vers 2]
Når julesneen falder ned
Når lys og mørke slutter fred
Måske det her ku' bli' vores sted
Hvis du tør gå med, gør det til virkelighed
Sig det, sig det

[Bro]
Luk mig ind, jeg vil se det nu
Alt det, som ingen ser
Tag mig med ind i drømmen nu
Jeg ved, der' meget mer'

[Omkvæd]
Tag mig med, tag mig med
Tag mig med, tag mig med nu
Tag mig med til det sted
Hvor verden ender
Luk mig ind, luk mig ind
Luk mig ind luk mig ind nu
Luk mig med til det sted
Hvor ilden brænder

[Vers 2]
Jeg ka' mærk' det, når jeg ser på dig
Jeg ka' hør' dig indeni
Alt, hva' vi ønsker os, det ka' vi få
Der er så meget, vi ikk' ka' forstå
Vi' ikk' alen' - hva' venter vi på?
Sig det, sig det

[Bro]
Luk mig ind, jeg vil se det nu
Alt det, som ingen ser
Tag mig med ind i drømmen nu
Jeg ved, der' meget mer'

[Omkvæd]
Tag mig med, tag mig med
Tag mig med, tag mig med nu
Tag mig med til det sted
Hvor verden ender
Luk mig ind, luk mig ind
Luk mig ind luk mig ind nu
Luk mig med til det sted
Hvor ilden brænder

[Post-omkvæd]
Det' som, når hjertet går itu
Når sjælen flyver
Ka' det ikke stoppe nu?
Tag mig med
Tag mig med, tag mig med
Tag mig med, tag mig med nu
Vis mig vejen til det sted
Hvor lykken vender

[Kontraststykke]
Alt det, vi ser, rummer så meget mer'
Mon englene danser omkring os?
Dybt indeni ved vi, alting ka' ske
Når vi lader drømmene i os vi-i-ise vej

[Omkvæd]
Tag mig med, tag mig med
Tag mig med, tag mig med nu
Tag mig med til det sted
Hvor verden ender
Luk mig ind, luk mig ind
Luk mig ind luk mig ind nu
Luk mig med til det sted
Hvor ilden brænder

[Post-omkvæd]
Det' som, når hjertet går itu
Når sjælen flyver
Ka' det ikke stoppe nu?
(Hvis bare du ku') Ta' mig med
Tag mig med, tag mig med
Tag mig med, tag mig med nu
Vis mig vejen til det sted
Hvor lykken vender




[Intro]
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more, because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

[Outro]
Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord, when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord, a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord, they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord, with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord, they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord, but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord, with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us  (So praise the lord)
And love may reign once more




[Vers 1: Stewart Stardust]
Nu' det jul igen, og hvad rager det mig?
Mit liv er i sit efterår, og der' et mavesår på vej
Min guldtand er knækket, og så 'det ikke skide skægt
At skide når man har en hæmoride som et hønseæg
Og jeg har liggesår og podegra og nyresvigt
Gule tænder, skrumpelever, hjertefejl og ledgigt
Jeg har et mareridt om min hund Rollo, der spø'r
En spillemand, om den må få mig med i himlen, når den dør

[Bro: Stewart Stardust]
Så hey Lillemor! (gå væk!) Har du nedtur? (gå væææk!)
Spild af tid, så snup en stesolid
For problemer er der nok af, hvor end man kigger hen
Men hvad rager det mig, nu' det jul igen

[Omkvæd: Stewart Stardust]
Alt kan ske når det er jul
Og selvom vores sne er gul
Så' det her (hey), det' bedst at bo (hoo)
Nu er det jul på Vesterbro
Byen over alle byer
Og selvom kærlighed er dyr
Så' det her (hey), det' bedst at bo (hoo)
Nu er det jul på Vesterbro

[Vers 2: Danny]
Nu' det jul igen, men det skider jeg da på
Min hue er så snavset, at den selv kan gå
Og jeg skylder tusind kroner til en fyr, der går med lædervest
Min krop er lige så plettet som min straffeattest
Går i fucking joggingsæt, og jeg har sår på mine knoer
Når jeg ikke sidder inde, bor jeg hoes min far og mor
Og det er vinter, det forvirrer mig med al det der sne
Forleden dag forsøgte jeg at sniffe Frederiksberg Allé

[Bro: Danny]
Så hey moar! (gå væk!) Har du nedtur? (gå væææk!)
Spild af tid, så snup en stesolid
For det' et hundeliv at leve som en hund eller al det der
Men det skider jeg da på, for nu det' jul igen

[Omkvæd: Stewart Stardust]
Alt kan ske når det er jul
Og selvom vores sne er gul
Så' det her (hey), det' bedst at bo (hoo)
Nu er det jul på Vesterbro
Byen over alle byer
Og selvom kærlighed er dyr
Så' det her (hey), det' bedst at bo (hoo)
Nu er det jul på Vesterbro

[Vers 3: Arne Nuggagren]
Nu' det jul igen og til hekkenfeldt med det
Der' ingen der gider smage på min hagenbutten/pfirsich te
Min 2cv har fået stjålet sine fælge
Og Lone skred i går med en fyr, der hedder Helge
Så kan man vælge bare at svælge i sorg og være bitter
For der er størknet linsesuppe på min sweater
Og jeg knokler for kommunen, selvom jeg næsten ingen gage får
Det eneste der kører for mig er mit pagehår

[Bro: Arne Nuggagren]
Så hey Vivian! (gå væk!) Har du nedtur? (gå væææk!)
Spild af tid, så snup en stesolid
For det ka' vær' herresvært at vær' socialforvalter, min ven
Men til hekken-fucking-feldt med det, for nu 'det jul igen (he he)

[Omkvæd: Stewart Stardust]
Alt kan ske når det er jul
Og selvom vores sne er gul
Så' det her (hey), det' bedst at bo (hoo)
Nu er det jul på Vesterbro
Byen over alle byer
Og selvom kærlighed er dyr
Så' det her (hey), det' bedst at bo (hoo)
Nu er det jul på Vesterbro
Alt kan ske når det er jul
Og selvom vores sne er gul
Så' det her (hey), det' bedst at bo (hoo)
Nu er det jul på Vesterbro
Byen over alle byer
Og selvom kærlighed er dyr
Så' det her (hey), det' bedst at bo (hoo)
Nu er det jul på Vesterbro

[Vers 1: Cisilia]
Ved du, hvad jeg ønsker mig?
Ønsker du ku' se
Vi var under solen
Nu 'vi klædt i sne
Du ved, at jeg smelter
Når jeg rammer din hud
Her i dine arme
Løber tiden ud

[Omkvæd: Cisilia & Hasan Shah]
Hvis du si'r, du vil ha' mig tilbage
Mærker jeg det i mit bryst
Og du sigted', ja, og baby, du ramte
Det her bli'r en kold december-cember
Baby, ikk' fordi jeg ikke ka' tilgi'
Og det' ikk' fordi, jeg ikk' har lyst

Jeg ka' se i mørket
Vores silhouette
Vi kaster skygger
Mens vi står her helt tæt
La' os bare være stille
Uh, jeg kender dit blik
Tror du bare, jeg glemmer
Alt det, du smed væk (u-u-u-u-u-uh-yeah)

[Omkvæd: Cisilia & Hasan Shah]
Hvis du si'r, du vil ha' mig tilbage
Mærker jeg det i mit bryst
Og du sigted', ja, og baby, du ramte (du sigted', og du ramte)
Det her bli'r en kold december-cember
Baby, ikk' fordi jeg ikke ka' tilgi' (no-oh)
Og det' ikk' fordi, jeg ikk' har lyst (woh-oh)
Men det ka' aldrig mer' bli' det samme
Det her bli'r en kold december-cember

[Kontraststykke: Cisilia & Hasan Shah]
Hold om mig, hold om mig
Før vinden ta'r dig med
Jeg ka' ikk' gi slip på dig (så mange minder)
Ka' ikk' slip på dig (hvert år, hver vinter)
Hold om mig, hold om mig
Mens sneen falder ned
Hold mig for sidste gang (jeg ka' ik' glem' dig)
Bare hold mig for sidste gang (hvert år, hver vinter)

[Omkvæd: Cisilia & Hasan Shah + begge]
Hvis du si'r, du vil ha' mig tilbage
Mærker jeg det i mit bryst
For du sigted', ja, og baby, du ramte

A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?

With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Pre-Chorus:
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me

I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow and
They believe again

Wake up the happiness
Come on you all

[Verse 1]
Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?
In the lane, snow is glist’nin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin’ in a winter wonderland

[Verse 2]
Gone away, is the bluebird
Here to stay, is the new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Chorus]
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?", We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

[Verse 3]
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Circus Clown
We’ll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

[Verse 4]
When it snows, ain’t it thrillin'
Though your nose, get’s a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Outro]
Walkin’ in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland




[Intro]
Ooo, Ooo

[Verse 1: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
But I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

It barely took a breath to realize
We’re going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Pre-Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Verse 2: Blake]
Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along, I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you baby
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas

[Pre-Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Bridge: Gwen & Blake]
I never thought I’d find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oooh, (thank you baby)

[Outro: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas




[Verse 1]
Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me
Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling
If you can't catch me, darling
Don't cry snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
Can't hold me close, baby

[Chorus]
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
Yeah you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on let's go
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now
It's Christmas, baby

[Refrain]
My snowman and me
My snowman and me
Baby

[Verse 2]
Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey

Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby
If you don't have ears, baby

[Chorus]
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
Yeah you are my home, my home for all seasons

I love you forever where we'll have some fun

Please don't cry no tears now
It's Christmas, baby

[Refrain]
My snowman and me
My snowman and me

[Verse 1]
It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday

With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe

I should be making a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

[Verse 1]
There is something special
About this time of year
A Christmas feeling's everywhere
I just got home to join you
I've been away too long (been away too long)
But now I'm back
To share my love
Friends are reunited
One big family
Filled with love
To last throughout the year

[Chorus]
Christmas time, time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world
Christmas time, the best time of the year
Yes, it's Christmas time (oh, Christmas time)

[Verse 2]
You and me together
Sleigh Ride in the Park
Loving kissing (straight from the heart)
Straight from the heart
Snowflakes falling gently
A smell of chestnuts in the air
And Christmas lights
They gleam across the sky, oh, it's Christmas time

[Chorus]
Christmas time, time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world
Christmas time, (it's Christmas time) the best time of the year
(the best time)
Yes, it's Christmas time (Christmas time)
Oh yes

[Verse 3]
Do you remember (do you remember)
Everything felt so nice
When I held you close to me
Do you remember
Those cold Christmas nights
When we saw the world in harmony

[Chorus]
Christmas time (Christmas time), time to share our love
(time to share our love)
Come and join the tidings to the world
(the tidings to the world)
Christmas time, (it's Christmas time) the best time of the year
(always the best time)
Yes, it's Christmas time (Christmas time)
(all around the world) It's Christmas time
(all the boys and girls)
Oh yes

[Verse 4]
Christmas time, time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world (to the world)
Christmas time, time to share our love (come and join)
Come and join the tidings to the world (come and join)

Christmas time, time to share our love (everybody sing)
Come and join the tidings to the world
Christmas time, time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world

[Chorus to fade]
Christmas time, time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world
Christmas time, time to share our love
Come and join the tidings to the world

Christmas time, time to share our love




[Verse 1]
Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

[Refrain]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

[Refrain]
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Oh, Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights, keep shining on




[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"




[Verse 1]
Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall
It's the time when every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer
Does a ton up on his sleigh
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day

[Hook]
So here it is, Merry Xmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best
Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest

[Hook]

What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissing Santa Claus A-ha

[Verse 3]
Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made
When you land upon your head
Then you bin slayed

[Hook x3]




If you remember the first time
Remember the night
If we stand together, under the lights
We'll get that old school feelin' back in our hearts
It's ok, it's alright
It's all about giving, give as you get
It's ok, it's alright

Ooh baby, it's been way too long
Go feel the love
Tomorrow it might be gone
'bout now December is here
We'll make it great like every year

It is Christmas let's do it again
Bring home the good times
Everyone's coming
So let the love in

There's a party at my house
That's where is at
And if the snow starts falling
Everybody's talking how the spirit is back




[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose, yeah
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Usher & Justin Bieber]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly, yeah

[Chorus: Usher & Justin Bieber]
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Yeah and so, I'm offering this simple phrase, oh woah
To kids from one to ninety-two, yeah yeah

And gay happy meetings when friends come to call

There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near

According to the radio
Warmer weathers in the wave
The chances are, we won't be getting snow
But even if the sun shines
From now to Christmasday
As far as i'm concerned, I know...
It's gonna be a cold cold Christmas without you
Dreaming of us warm warm lazy summerday's
It's gonna be a long and lonely Christmas without you
Missing you my darling in oh so many way's
Yesterday I saw your mom and dad
We bought our cards together
I've put the presents on de Christmastree
And there's I write this letter
It's warm, inside, the lockvice burning right oh darling
If only you were here, to make it right
It's gonna be a cold cold Christmas without you
Dreaming of us warm warm lazy summerday's
It's gonna be a long and lonely Christmas without you
Missing you my darling in oh so many way's
I didn't bought a wrath or mistletoe
You won't be here to kiss me
The only constellation that i've got
I'll know for sure you miss me
It won't be long untill you're home again
And we can share this magic moments
But till then...
It's gonna be a cold cold Christmas without you
Dreaming of us warm warm lazy summerday's

Missing you my darling in oh so many way's




[Verse 1]
It's that time of year I treasure
The time for giving, the best part of living
To celebrate with friends we hold so dear
Well, I can feel it in the air
All bundled head-to-toe
Too cold to bear, it's the best time of the year

[Pre-Chorus]
I got my stocking, got my Christmas tree
Got my loved ones next to me

[Chorus]
It's almost here
So spread some cheer
Let's give love and get some back
The more you give, the more you'll have
The fire's bright now
And snow comes down
Grab your friends; hold them near
Christmas time is here
Whoo!

[Verse 2]
Every house on every corner
Stringing up the Christmas lights
People caroling, "O Christmas Tree"
"How you shine so bright for me"
Children 'round the world
Shouting "Santa's on his way"
Hoping to hear those sleigh bells ringing on his sleigh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna wrap my arms around you tight
On this cold December night

[Chorus]
It's almost here
So spread some cheer

[1.vers Rasmus Bjerg]
Der er sgu altid så mange problemer
Så snart vi snakker Jul og hvad vi vil
Det handler om forskellighed
Pigerne stresser rundt med gavesystemer, de poster julemad på Instagram
Vi er mere til billiard, og lidt Spotify med Wham
Det har så givet mig en ide, vi holder julen hver for sig
Og så tager boisne sgu på drengetur med mig

[Omkvæd Rasmus Bjerg, Citybois]
Vi ved præcis, hvad det er der skal til
Vi gør nøjagtig, alt det som vi vil
Vi nyder en six-pack imens vi hører Last Christmas (uh ja)
Ingen spil eller ku' kun det vi kan lide
Ingen snik snak, spræden en skod energi
Det er så vigtigt at vi får en rigtig drenge jul

[2.vers Rasmus Bjerg]
Vi pjatter lidt og ser lidt Disney Sjov (kolon)
Og drikker shots med gløgg uden at spørge om lov
Vi slås med puder, og hygger i kanen
Vi ser et blad med store nissemænd
Vi får ild i pejsen, og hygger vi lidt igen
Der er så meget vi skal nå, og vi kan vædde en million
På at det her bliver en juletradition

[Omkvæd Rasmus Bjerg, Citybois]
Vi gør præcis lige det som vi vil
Vi spiser and uden tilbehør til
Vi går om træet imens vi synger Last Christmas (uh ja)
Vi deler gaver ud og hvem ved, så kommer julemanden måske
Det er så vildt, at vi nu har sådan en rigtig drengejul

[3.vers Thor]
Uh det er så Scarlet alt det her
Fri fra damejagt og julehysteri
Det er så mega pat, og det er den sygeste ide
Det er som om vi før var blinde, men vores drengejul får os til at se (uh ja)

[Omkvæd Rasmus Bjerg, Citybois]
Vi ved præcis, hvad det er der skal til
Vi klæder os ud, og leger krybespil
Vi smutter mandler imens vi hører Last Christmas (uh ja)
Vi brænder nødder på et komfur, og dypper kuglerne i lækker glasur
Det er så vigtig at, det bliver en rigtig drengejul
Vi ved præcis, hvad det er der skal til
Vi dyrker sekser i terningespil
Vi gnider øjne imens vi hører Last Christmas (uh ja)
Vi putter tæt, det er drenge magi
Det er surt julen snart er forbi
Men næste år skal vi også have en rigtig drengejuuul (ja ja drengejul uh)




[Vers 1]
Her hos dig, her hos dig
Tænker jeg så klart, åh, så klart, åh, så klart
Jeg' lidt for trist og lidt forladt
På en kold og mørk decembernat
Stjerner kigger ind, mon de ser, mon de ser
Tåren på min kind? Mon de ved, hva’ det er, der sker?
Hvem er fjende, hvem er ven?
Og hvem ka' vise vejen hjem igen?
Ja, hjem igen

[Omkvæd]
For sneen falder overalt
Men her hos dig er altid plads til mig
Jeg stoler blindt på dig
For jeg' en bonde i et kongespil
Hvor hjerterne er frosset til, og jeg
Jeg stoler blindt på dig

[Vers 2]
Verden er så stor, og hvem er jeg? Jeg’ bare mig
Jeg ved jo ikke spor, men jeg vil, og jeg tror, jeg ka'
Finde gnisten indeni
Sætte alle julehjerter fri

[Omkvæd]
For sneen falder overalt
Men her hos dig er altid plads til mig
Jeg stoler blindt på dig
For jeg' en bonde i et kongespil
Hvor hjerterne er frosset til, og jeg
Jeg stoler blindt på dig

[Kontraststykke]
Så bli', bli' hos mig
For uden dig så fryser jeg

[Omkvæd]
For sneen falder overalt
Men her hos dig er altid plads til mig
Jeg stoler blindt på dig
For jeg' en bonde i et kongespil
Hvor hjerterne er frosset til, og jeg
Jeg stoler blindt på dig

[Outro]
Mmh-mmh-mmh
Her hos dig, her hos dig




[Verse]
O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

[Chorus]
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine

[Chorus]
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine, yeah
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine (O night divine)
Ooh, yes it was (O night divine)
Oh, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth (O night divine)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, it is (O night divine)
It was a long night, long night, long night
Oh, oh, oh, woah, woah, woah, yes it was (O night divine)




[Verse 1]
Ah yeah
Candles burning low, lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols right outside my door

[Chorus]
All these things and more (All these things and more, my baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Ah yeah

[Verse 2]
And ya know what I mean
I see your smiling face like I've never seen before
Even though I love ya madly, it seems I love you more
And the little thoughts you give me touch my heart for sure

[Chorus]
Oh, all these things and more
(All these things and more, my darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Ah yeah

[Bridge]
I feel like running wild, I feel just like a little child
Bring you 'neath the mistletoe
I kiss you once, and then some more
Wish you a merry Christmas, baby
(Wish you a merry Christmas, baby)
And such happiness in the coming year, oh
(Happiness in the coming year)
Let's deck the halls with holly, singing "Silent Night"
Dress the trees with angel hair, and pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up just before daylight

[Chorus]
Oh, all these things and more, darling
(All these things and more, my darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Oh yeah, yeah




[Verse 1]
Babe, I woke up and I, watched the snow fall from my sky
Babe, I woke up and I, felt a tear slip from my eye
Babe, I woke up and I, wished for just another night
No-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no

[Verse 2]
Babe, I can hardly breathe without you right next to me
Babe, I can hardly breathe, who'll carry my Christmas tree?
Babe, I can hardly breathe, wish I hadn't let you leave
No-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so chilly without you near me
My everyday Santa Claus
So, baby, come quickly
It's starting to heal me
I need my old Santa Claus

[Chorus]
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?

[Verse 3]
Babe, I woke up solo, wished I hadn't let you go
Babe, I woke up solo, saw your footsteps in the snow
Babe, I woke up solo, loved you so, I loved you so
No-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so chilly without you near me
My everyday Santa Claus
So, baby, come quickly
It's starting to heal me
I need my old Santa Claus

[Chorus]
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?




[Vers 1]
Hey mor, hvorfor er alt så mørkt i november
Hey mor, når alt er så lyst i december?
Jeg tror, at hvis alle gik sammen, som de gør nu
Så ville hver dag være en gave før jul, ja
Hey far, hvorfor er alt så koldt i januar
Hey far, når alt er så varmt i december?
Jeg tror, at hvis alle gik sammen, som de gør nu
Så ville hver dag være en gave før jul, ja

[Omkvæd]
Men hey, hva' ka' vi gøre?
Hva' ska' vi lære og hvordan bli'r det større?
Der' noget ved det, hey spejlbillede
La' mig bli' bedre efter nytår
Så det går januar, februar, marts, april, maj, juni, juli
August, september, oktober, november, december
Til det bli'r jul igen

[Vers 2]
Hey bror, hvorfor er bladene røde i september
Hey bror, når træet er grønt i december?
Jeg tror, at hvis alle gik sammen, som de gør nu
Så ville hver dag være en gave før jul, ja
Verden vender, årstiderne skifter
Efter sommer kommer efterår kommer vinter
Og når bladene skyder og solen den bryder frem
Glemmer vi alt det som december kan, ja
Glemmer vi alt det som december kan

[Omkvæd]
Men hey, hva' ka' vi gøre?
Hva' ska' vi lære og hvordan bli'r det større?
Der' noget ved det, hey spejlbillede
La' mig bli' bedre efter nytår
Så det går januar, februar, marts, april, maj, juni, juli
August, september, oktober, november, december
Til det bli'r jul igen (til det bli'r jul igen)
Til det bli'r jul igen (yeah)

[Outro]
Hey søster, jeg håber du ka' fortælle mig
Hey søster, hvorfor vi kun ses i december
Jeg tror, at hvis alle gik sammen, som de gør nu
Så ville hver dag være en gave før jul, ja




En stjerne på himlen
Og flere og flere
I nat føder himlen
Med jordiske veer
I nat lover himlen
At den vil befri os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

Maria skal føde
Sin glæde med smerte
Der banker et hjerte
Bag vinterens hjerte
Selv kulden og mørket
Har håb de vil gi os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

Hun bærer på barnet
Nu føler hun veen
Et hjerte så trodsigt
Som spurvens i sneen
En krybbe til vugge
For den som skal fri os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias. (Lille Messias)

Og han som bær verden
Bar hun som var kvinde
Som æslet bar hende
Da tiden var inde
Fred lyder det råb
Som nu genlyder i os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

I nat ruger himlen
På glæden og freden
Så varsomt i mørket
Som fuglen i reden
Og freden og glæden
Nu fødes de i os
Maria på æslet
Med lille Messias

I fødslen er glæden
Forbundet med smerten
Dog aldrig var glæden
Så hjemløs i verden
Men stalden og krybben
Er tegn som skal si' os
Maria fandt plads
Da hun fødte Messias

En plads mellem får
I en stald mellem stude
Hun fødte og svøbte
Den lille i klude
Og hyrdernes glæde
Var stor som Marias
Lys tændes i mørket
Nu fødtes Messias
Nu fødtes Messias
Nu fødtes Messias




[Vers 1]
Julen kommer, før end vi ved
Og lille Peter gemmer på en julehemmelighed
Men lidt må han fortælle, for så'n er jo børn
Og derfor hvisker Peter til sin gamle teddybjørn (Uh)

[Omkvæd]
Jeg så julemanden kysse mor
I går aftes i den mørke gang (Ah)
Jeg selv var lagt i seng
Som en artig lille dreng
Men døren stod på klem
Og ud af dynerne jeg sprang
Så jeg julemanden kysse mor
Nej, hun blev ikke vred, nej, ikke spor
Men ih, hvor far da dog havde leet
Hvis han havde stået og set
Julemanden sådan kysse mor

[Vers 2]
Længe stod de sammen de to
Og mor trak op i julemandens vams, imens hun lo
Hun sagd', han var ukendelig, men sikke noget præk
Jeg kendte ham da lige med det samme på hans skæg
Ja, jeg gjorde

[Omkvæd]
Jeg så julemanden kysse mor
I går aftes i den mørke gang (Ah)
Jeg selv var lagt i seng (Lagt i seng)
Som en artig lille dreng
Men døren stod på klem
Og ud af dynerne jeg sprang
Jeg julemanden kysse mor (Kysse mor, ja)
Nej, hun blev ikke vred, nej, ikke spor
Men ih, hvor far da dog havde leet (Havde leet)
Hvis han havde stået og set
Julemanden sådan kysse mor

[Outro]
Det var ham, jeg ved, jeg så ham
Kysse mor (Kysse mor)
Det var ham, jeg ved, jeg så ham
Kysse mor, ja, kysse mor
Det var ham, jeg ved, jeg så ham (Ved hva' jeg så)
Kysse mor (Ja, jeg ved, hva' jeg så)
Det var ham, jeg ved, jeg så ham
Kysse mor

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The party's on

[Vers 1]
Hvert år i december
Står jeg her, og jeg venter
På at du kommer forbi
Jeg har prøvet alt for at glem' dig
Har swipet alt ind' på Tinder
Men det' kun dig, jeg ka' li'

[Bro]
Men jeg har fucket op alt for mange gange
Jeg var pisse ligeglad, da du var bange
For at jeg ville gøre de ting, jeg gjorde
Så jeg tror ikk', at

[Omkvæd]
Den her december den bli'r min
For alt, jeg ønsker, det er hende
Men jeg har måske været lidt slem i år
Ja, jeg har ventet under mistelten'
Men det virker ikk', når jeg' alen'
For jeg har måske været lidt slem i år
Ja, igen, igen i år

[Vers 2]
Alle går og si'r, at tiden heler alle sår
Ja, men inderst inde ved jeg godt, at den bli'r svær i år

[Bro]
Men jeg har fucket op alt for mange gange
Jeg var pisse ligeglad, da du var bange
For at jeg ville gøre de ting, jeg gjorde
Så jeg tror ikk', at

[Omkvæd]
Den her december den bli'r min
For alt, jeg ønsker, det er hende
Men jeg har måske været lidt slem i år (Været lidt slem i år)
Ja, jeg har ventet under mistelten'
Men det virker ikk', når jeg' alen'
For jeg har måske været lidt slem i år
Ja, igen, igen i år (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Ja, igen, igen i år (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)
Måske lidt ekstra slem i år

[Kontraststykke]
Hvert år i december

En mørk og kold december aften
Vinden pev og sneen føg
Vi sad og hørte radio
En melodi, en simpel sang
Historien om den der gang
To mus faldt ned i en spand med mælk
De skreg, men der kom ingen hjælp
Og snart så var det jul

To trætte mus i en spand med mælk
De svømmede rundt så godt de ku'
Men håbet svandt - hva gør vi nu?
Den ene ville drukne sig
Men makkeren sagde nej, nej, nej
For håbet sejrer kun, måske
Så længe vi leder efter det
Bliv ved at lede efter det

Så svømmede de, som aldrig før
Og mælken blev til sidst til smør
Så kravlede de op på land
Stod frem og knugede hinanden
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul
Og ønskede glædelig jul (Merry Christmas)
Og ønskede glædelig jul (Merry Christmas)
Og ønskede glædelig jul (Merry Christmas)




[Vers 1]
Vil du være min i nat?
Vil du gi' mig lidt af dit hjerte?
Du ku' være min ledestjerne
Så ku' jeg være månen
Jeg vil ikk' ku' love noget
Ønsker bare, at du er min
Ska' vi ikk' gå samme vej?
La' os bruge natten til noget

[Bro]
Jeg vil tælle hvert skridt, vi ta'r
Selvom vejen hjem er lang
Jeg vil følge dit åndedrag
Og synge dig en lille sang

[Omkvæd]
Vil du være min i nat?
Vil du gi' mig lidt af dit hjerte?

[Instrumental solo]

[Vers 2]
Jeg vil ikk' ku' love noget

[Verse 1]
It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

[Verse 2]
Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No, no, no, downtown)
Even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out
Ain't no ice or no chills
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

[Bridge]
Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

[Chorus]
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey




[Verse 1]
This is the season when all you believe in is possible
[?] and [?] blessing my radio
Outside it's freezing so we bring the trees in and light up
No [?], no reason the holiday season can’t make you smile

[Chorus]
I wish I could (I wish I could)
But I miss my baby (I miss my baby)
I'm talking 'bout you
I tried to be good (I tried to be good)
But I just can’t fake it (I just can't fake it)
I'm not over you

[Verse 2]
Spending my savings and Christmas-behaving like crazy
Sometimes I'm like, "What if we spent all that money on charity?"
Reindeers parading, sleigh bells, and snow angels
Jake Frost is fading, when though else ice skating
Warm fireplaces and it's all amazing
Still, I can't lie

[Chorus]
I wish I could (I wish I could)
But I miss my baby (I miss my baby)
I'm talking 'bout you
I tried to be good (I tried to be good)
But I just can’t fake it (I just can’t fake it)
I'm not over you (I’m not over, I'm not over, I'm not over you)

[Outro]
Oh, I'm in tears and it’s the same
Every damn year on my holiday
[?]




[Vers 1]
Hemmeligheds
-fulde falder fnuggene ned
Som stjernestøv
Og maler bøgeskoven hvid

[Bro]
Hold om mig
Det er så koldt her uden dig

[Omkvæd]
Uden hinanden er vi ingenting:
To snefnug, der hvirvler i en vintervind
Men hvis vi står sammen
I Pagten, vil ingen kunne skille os ad

[Vers 2]
Kolde kys
Smelter mod min varme hud
Skynd dig nu
Inden tiden løber ud

[Bro]
Hold om mig
Det er så koldt her uden dig

[Omkvæd]
Uden hinanden er vi ingenting:
To snefnug der hvirvler i en vintervind
Men hvis vi står sammen
I Pagten, vil ingen kunne skille os ad
Uden hinanden er vi ingenting
To snefnug der hvirvler i en vintervind
Men hvis vi står sammen
I Pagten, vil ingen kunne skille os ad

[Violin solo: Alis]

[Omkvæd]
Uden hinanden er vi ingenting
To snefnug der hvirvler i en vintervind
Men hvis vi står sammen
I Pagten, vil ingen kunne skille os ad
Uden hinanden er vi ingenting
To snefnug der hvirvler i en vintervind
Men hvis vi står sammen
I Pagten, vil ingen kunne skille os ad

Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!

[Verse 1]
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus (kissing, kissing, Santa Claus)
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom, fast asleep

[Chorus]
Then I saw mommy tickle, tickle (tickle, tickle, Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

[Bridge]
He saw mommy kissing (kissing, kissing, Santa Claus)
I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

[Verse 2]
Then I saw mommy tickle (tickle, tickle, Santa Claus)

Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Right up at the top (And I can't deny)
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Hey, hey, yeah
Everyday, la-la-la
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
No matter the reason, no matter decision
My heart will keep beatin', you better believe
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you




Så' det jul
Lykkehjul
Vær vor gæst
Det' hjerternes fest
Vær velkommen
Store og små
Jesus kommer med næste tog

November kom med syndflod af regn
Og mørke midt på dagen
Men vi kender vejen

For nu er det jul
Lykkehjul
Vær vor gæst
Det' hjerternes fest
Husk på vi var selv uskyldige små
Svøbt i stjernestøv fra top til tå
Yeahhh .....

Når lysene de tændes i tusinde hjem
Og stjernen dukker frem over Betlehem

Så' det jul
Lykkehjul
Vær vor gæst
Det' hjerternes fest
Vær velkommen
Store og små
Jesus kommer med næste tog




[Verse 1]
I'm on my way through the dark and the fallin' snow
Driving home for Christmas while it plays on the radio (Mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
But something doesn't feel like it's supposed to feel
I thought I was fine but now it's all too real

[Chorus]
I don't really give a damn about the presents
'Cause this year I didn't get one with your name
Christmas ain't, it ain't the same without you

[Verse 2]
All by myself on the couch, staring at my phone (Oh-oh)
Every single channel on the TV showing Home Alone (Oh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But something doesn't feel like it's supposed to feel
I thought I was fine but now it's all too real

[Chorus]
I don't really give a damn about the presents
'Cause this year I didn't get one with your name
Christmas ain't, it ain't the same without you

[Bridge]
(Without you) There's no light in the dark
(Without you) Feels like I'm missing a part
(Without you) Right here in my arms
Christmas just ain't the same

[Chorus]
I don't really give a damn about the presents
'Cause this year I didn't get one with your name
Christmas ain't, it ain't the same without you
Without you
I don't really give a damn about the presents
'Cause this year I didn't get one with your name (Your name)
Christmas ain't, it ain't the same without you (Oh, no)

[Outro]
Without you
Without you




[Verse 1]
I don't need my stocking filled with toys
And I don't need no gifts to bring me joy
Baby, I-I haven't hung my mistletoe
'Cause without you, baby, I can't see no point

[Chorus]
Baby I hope Santa brings you to me
'Cause it's all I wished for this Christmas Eve
No, I don't want much, your love is all I need
Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me

[Refrain]
Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (Deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year
Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (Deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna light this tree alone (No, no, I can't)
I can't sing Christmas songs if you're not home
No, I-I haven't hung my mistletoe
'Cause without you, baby, I can't see no point

[Chorus]
Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me
'Cause it's all I wished for this Christmas Eve
No, I don't want much, your love is all I need
Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me

[Refrain]
Hope he's bringing me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (Deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year

[Verse 3]
It's been so cold since you've been gone (Been gone)
This winter seems so long (So long)
And I can't get in no spirit
It feels so wrong

[Bridge]
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I deserve you here
Bring me love this Christmas
'Cause I've been good this year

[Refrain]
Hope he's bringing me love (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (Deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year
Hope he's bringing me love (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (Deserve you here)
Bring me love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year
Hope he's bringing me love (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I deserve you here (Deserve you here)
Bring me love love this Christmas (Love this Christmas)
'Cause I've been good this year

[Outro]
Hey (Love this Christmas)
Would you bring me love (Deserve you here)
(Love this Christmas) yeah, yeah
(Good this year)
(Love this Christmas) It's the only thing I need baby (Deserve you here)
(Love this Christmas) yeah
Ho, ho, ho, ah
Yeahhh




[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice as shy
I kept my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
"Merry Christmas", I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
And if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 3]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now, I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special




Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list




We waited all through the year
For the day to appear
When we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

Please tell me Christmas will never go away




[Vers 1]
Uret tikker, tiden går - hvad venter du på?
La' den ikke gå i stå
Hvis vi tager chancen, og hvis vi formår
At følges ad, vil det jo gå

[Omkvæd]
Flyver gennem tid og sted
Passer på – jeg falder ned
Ender på et fremmed sted
Alt jeg vil er kun at finde ro og skabe fred
Gennem tid og sted
Minderne de ta’r mig med
Prøver på at finde fred
I tidsrejsen

[Vers 2]
Kan du skimte udenfor at træerne står
Selvom alle blade forgår
Tiden læger alle sår, det mærker du, når
Træet er grønt igen til næste år

[Omkvæd]
Flyver gennem tid og sted
Passer på – jeg falder ned
Ender på et fremmed sted
Alt jeg vil er kun at finde ro og skabe fred
Gennem tid og sted
Minderne de ta’r mig med
Prøver på at finde fred
I tidsrejsen
I tidsrejsen

[Kontraststykke]
Falder vi ind i tiden?
Glemmer vi før eller siden
Hvor vi kommer fra
Hvor det er, vi kommer fra
Tager vi fat og kæmper?
Husker på dem vi elsker
Får vi altid svar?
Får vi altid hjertets svar?

[Omkvæd]
Flyver gennem tid og sted
Passer på – jeg falder ned
Ender på et fremmed sted
Alt jeg vil er kun at finde ro og skabe fred
Gennem tid og sted
Minderne de ta’r mig med
Prøver på at finde fred
I tidsrejsen




[Verse 1]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer?
Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

[Chorus]
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell you
That old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock-'n'-rolling with the rest

[Chorus]
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Sigue]
What will your daddy do when he sees your momma kissing Santa Claus?

[Verse 2]
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you've been slayed

[Chorus]
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
(It's only just begun)

So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
(Everybody's having fun)
Look to the future now
It's only just begun




The child is a king, the carolers sing
The old has passed, there's a new beginning
Dreams of Santa, dreams of snow
Fingers numb, faces aglow

Christmas time, mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

A time for living, a time for believing
A time for trusting, not deceiving
Love and laughter and joy ever after
Ours for the taking, just follow the master

Christmas time, mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

A time for giving, a time for getting
A time for forgiving and for forgetting
Christmas is love, Christmas is peace
A time for hating and fighting to cease

Christmas time, mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

Christmas time, mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

Christmas time, mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see




[Vers 1]
Nu står du der helt alene
Lidt genert under misteltenen
Du ser på mig som i gamle dage
Det ta'r mig tilbage, det ta'r mig tilbage

[Bro]
Vi sagde stop i september
Fortrød det oktober, savned' november
Jeg ka' ikke glem' dig
Ka' vi ikk' tænd' et nyt lys i december?

[Omkvæd]
Tag mig tilbage nu
Det' kun dig, jeg vil ha' til jul
Og du ka' få hva' du vil - ingen årsag
Du ka' gøre næste jul til vores årsdag
Men tag mig tilbage nu

[Vers 2]
Julelys i over hele byen
Og uden dig - det' et ensomt syn, men
Mennesker samles, når sneen falder
Jeg håber du kalder, jeg håber du kalder

[Bro]
Vi sagde stop i september
Fortrød det oktober, savned' november
Jeg ka' ikke glem' dig
Ka' vi ikk' tænd' et nyt lys i december?

[Omkvæd]
Tag mig tilbage nu
Det' kun dig, jeg vil ha' til jul
Og du ka' få hva' du vil - ingen årsag
Du ka' gøre næste jul til vores årsdag
Men tag mig tilbage nu

[Kontraststykke]
Ingen gave ku' gøre mig glad
Det' kun dig, der gi'r mig fred
Jeg ku' gi' dig, hva' du vil
For at få en chance til
For ingen gave ku' gøre mig glad
Det' kun dig, der gi'r mig fred
Så tag mig tilbage

[Omkvæd]
Tag mig tilbage nu
Det' kun dig, jeg vil ha' til jul
Og du ka' få hva' du vil - ingen årsag
Du ka' gøre næste jul til vores årsdag
Men tag mig tilbage nu
Tag mig tilbage nu
Det' kun dig, jeg vil ha' til jul
Og du ka' få hva' du vil - ingen årsag
Du ka' gøre næste jul til vores årsdag
Men tag mig tilbage nu




You might as well
You might as well wrap yourself
May beneath our tree
Cause you’ve always been the perfect gift for me

No, don’t go it’s cold
There's snow on the road
So why don’t you come sit by the fire?
I’ll pour a drink
Then we can share this memory of

You right here with me
It’s something kind of wonderful
On Christmas eve
It’s crazy to think of all the little miracles
That brought you here to me

You might as well
You might as well dress yourself
Mistletoe for me
So I can steal a kiss whenever I please

Oh, oh what a night
The stars and the lights
Family and friends around the fire
A toast and a drink
Then we can sing this melody of

You right here with me
It’s something kind of wonderful
On Christmas eve
It’s crazy to think of all the little miracles
That brought you here

When I close my eyes
I wish that the love I've inside never fades
It always feels this way
There's not a time or place I’d rather be
Than here tonight

Something kind of
Something kind of

You right here with me
It’s something kind of wonderful
On Christmas eve
It’s crazy to think of all the little miracles
That brought you here to me

You right here with me It’s something kind of wonderful
On Christmas eve
It’s crazy to think of all the little miracles
That brought you here to me

It’s crazy to think of all the miracles
That brought you here to me, yeah




[Verse 1]
Tell me, where did we go wrong?
We should be singing Christmas songs
Instead of shouting all night long like we do
We keep fighting in the street
When we should be home wrapped in the sheets
Putting presents underneath the tree for me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we had our fair share
Of breaking up, and making up
I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up, no

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll be together
Baby, all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Verse 2]
It hasn't been the greatest year
But through thick and thin we made it here
Just keep holding onto me, and I'll hold you
But we made it through the hardest part
And I followed you, the brightest star
I just wanna be where you are, right where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we've had our fair share
Of breaking up, yeah, and making up
But I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up, no, don't

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll have together
Baby, all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Bridge]
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah

[Outro]
If we can make it through December (A-a-all I want, yeah)
Every New Year we'll be together (A-a-all I want, yeah)
'Cause all I want for Christmas (A-a-all I want, yeah)
Is you and me to fix this (A-a)




Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who were near to us
Will be dear to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas, now




I really can't stay/(Baby I'm fine with that)

I've got to go away (Baby I'm cool with that)

This evening has been (Been hoping you get home safe)

So very nice (I'm glad you had a real good time)

My mother will start to worry (Call her so she knows that you're coming)

Father will be pacing the floor (Better get your car a-humming)

So really I'd better scurry (No rush)

Should I use the front or back door? (Which one are you pulling towards more?)

The neighbors might think (That you're a real nice girl)

What is this drink? (Pomegranate La Croix)

I wish I knew how (Maybe I can help you out)

To break this spell (I don't know what you're talking about)

I ought to say no, no, no (you reserve the right to say no)

At least I'm gonna say that I tried (you reserve the right to say no)

I really can't stay (...Well you don't have to)

Baby it's cold outside

I've got to get home (Do you know how to get there from here)

Say, where is my coat (I'll go and grab it my dear)

You've really been grand (We'll have to do this again)

Yes I agree (How 'bout the Cheesecake Factory?)

We're bound to be talking tomorrow (Text me at your earliest convenience)

At least I have been getting that vibe (Unless I catch pneumonia and die)

I'll be on my way (Thanks for the great night)




I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white




O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees O hear the angels voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend

He knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever
His power and glory evermore proclaim
O night divine, O night, O night divine

[Verse 1: Hannah Grace, Hannah Grace and Gabrielle Aplin]
In the bleak midwinter, frost winds made moan
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter, long ago

[Verse 2: Gabrielle Aplin, Gabrielle Aplin and Hannah Grace]
Angels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air
But his mother only, in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss
Hm

[Verse 3: Gabrielle Aplin and Hannah Grace]
Oh, what can I give him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb
If I were a wise man, I would do my part
Yet what I can I give him
I will give my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Gabrielle Aplin, Hannah Grace]
In the bleak midwinter, frost wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone

[Verse 1]
Sleigh bells ring
Church bells too
Three days after Christmas
I met you
I wore a big white dress
You wore a fancy suit
The easiest thing
That I'll ever do
We knew it from the start
It was simple, it was true
The snow fell from the sky
I fell in love with you
At least a thousand times

[Chorus]
And now
Every Christmas from now on
I'll be here by your side
And now
Every day in between
And for all of our lives
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
And any kiss from you, you know
I do, I do, I do
From now on
All my Christmases with you

And now
Every Christmas from now on
I'll be here by your side

There will be days that we'll be cold
There will be times when we won't know
What life will throw, but
I'll be beside you

And now
Every day in between
And for all of our lives
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
We're walking in a winter wonderland

And gone away (gone away) is the bluebird (is the bluebird)
But here to stay stay stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
We're walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on (later on! ), we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire, babe
We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

And later on (later on! ), we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland

We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made
We're walking in a winter wonderland
(Walking in a winter wonderland.)

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom Angels greet
With anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding
Good Christians fear
For sinners here
The silent Word is pleading

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe, the Son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Nails, spears shall pierce Him through
The cross He bore for me, for you
Hail, hail the word made flesh
The babe, the Son of Mary




[Verse 1]
Santa Baby
Slip a sable under the tree
For me
Been an awful good girl
Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2]
Santa baby
A '54 convertible too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear
Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check off my Christmas list

[Verse 3]
Santa Baby
I want a yacht and really that's not
A lot
Been an angel all year
Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 4]
Santa Honey
There's one more thing I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa Cutie
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Bridge]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

[Outro]
Santa Baby
Forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone
Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
So hurry down the chimney tonight




Frosted window panes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy cains
On the tree
Santa's on his way
And he's filled his slay with
Things
Things for you and for me
It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas
May your new year dream come true
And this song of mine
In three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too
The same thing too
It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas
May your new year dream come true
And this song of mine
In three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too
The same thing too
The same thing too
Me and you
The same thing too




[Chorus 1 - Both; Gabrielle Aplin]
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

[Chorus 2 - Hannah Grace; Both; Gabrielle Aplin]
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
Oh but I'll (but I’ll) have a blue, blue blue Christmas

[Bridge - Both]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

[Chorus 2 - Both; Hannah Grace; Gabrielle Aplin]
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
Oh but I'll (but I’ll) have a blue, blue blue Christmas




[Verse 1]
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

Come and save my soul

[Verse 2]
The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh

Come and save my soul
[Instrumental interlude]

[Verse 3]
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

Come and save my soul




[Verse 1]
Hark, the herald angels sing
“Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth, and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled”
Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
“Christ is born in Bethlehem”

[Refrain]
Hark, the herald angels sing
“Glory to the newborn King”

[Verse 2]
Christ, by highest Heaven adored
Christ the everlasting Lord
Late in time, behold Him come
Offspring of a virgin’s womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with man to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel

[Refrain]
Hark, the herald angels sing
“Glory to the newborn King”

[Bridge]
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria

[Verse 3]
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace
Hail the Sun of Righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings
Mild, He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth

[Refrain]
Hark, the herald angels sing
“Glory to the newborn King
Glory to the newborn King”




[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, I love you, I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special




You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's makin' a list
Checkin' it twice
Gonna find out
Who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Oh, yes he is

The kids in girl and boyland
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland
All around the Christmas tree

So, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town




O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, oh come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the king of angels
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Sing, Choirs of angles
Sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above!
Glory to God
Glory in the highest
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord




Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping on your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way;
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gone spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
For kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

They know that Santa's on his way;
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gone spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
For kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you




[Verse 1]
I've got an angel
She doesn't wear any wings
She wears a heart that can melt my own
Wears a smile that can make me wanna sing

[Verse 2]
She gives me presents
With her presence alone
She gives me everything I could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home

[Verse 3]
She can make angels
Seen it with my own eyes
You gotta be careful when you've got good love
'Cause then angels will just keep on multiplying

[Chorus]
Aw, but you're so busy changing the world
Just one smile and you could change all of mine
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh ohhh
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh ohhh
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh ohhh
Oh oh oh ohhh
Oh oh oh




Maybe this Christmas will mean something more
Maybe this year love will appear
Deeper than ever before

And maybe forgiveness will ask us to call
Someone we love, someone we've lost
For reasons we can’t quite recall
Maybe this Christmas

Maybe there’ll be an open door
Maybe the star that shone before
Will shine once more, oh

And maybe this Christmas will find us at last
In heavenly peace, grateful at least
For the love we've been shown in the past, oh
Maybe this Christmas, maybe this Christmas




[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So it's Christmas once more




[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)




[Intro]
Ah, aha
Ooh, ohh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away

This year, to save me from tears

Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Verse 3]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears

[Outro]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Special...
Someone...

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear

It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories

There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

Have yourself a merry little Christmas, let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas, make the yule-tide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

Someday soon, we all will be together, if the fates allow
Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

-Merry Christmas, ladies

Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, j-j-j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what a lotta fun, what a lotta fun to ride and sing
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow (we are dashing)
In a one horse open sleigh (one horse sleigh)
O'er the fields we go (o'er the fields we go, we go)
Laughing all the way (all the way)
Bells on bobtail ring

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Just walking, talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland




[Chorus]
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

[Chorus]
Santa Claus is comin' to town, oh yeah
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town

[Bridge]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
(Be good for goodness sake)

Oh, you'd better watch out (Watch out)
You'd better not cry (Woo hoo)
Better not pout
I'm telling you why

[Verse 4]
Little tin horns, and little toy drums
Rooty-toot-toot, and rump-a-tum-tums
Curly-haired dolls, that tootle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too

[Chorus]
Oh! Santa Claus is comin' to town, oh yeah
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
One more time now
Santa Claus is comin' to town, oh yeah
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town




[Intro]
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more, because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

[Outro]
Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord, when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord, a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord, they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord, with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord, they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord, but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord, with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us  (So praise the lord)
And love may reign once more




(Ding-dong-ding)

I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

(Ding-dong-ding) Have a holly jolly Christmas

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Candles burning low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols
Right outside my door

[Chorus]
All these things and more
(all these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(that's what Christmas means to me my love)

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

And ya know what I mean
I see your smiling face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
The little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

[Chorus]
All these things and more, darling
(all these things and more, darling)
Whoa
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(that's what Christmas means to me my love)

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah ha ha
I feel like running wild
(Running wild)
As anxious as a little child
Greet you neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the coming year
(Happiness in the coming year)
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

[Chorus]
All these things and more, baby
(all these things and more, baby)
Whoa
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(that's what Christmas means to me my love)
Oh baby baby

[Outro]
Yeah
Candles burning low
Lots and lots of snow
Alright
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas choirs singing
Coo
Christmas mistletoe




[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"




Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you




Out of all the reindeers, you know you're the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randalph ain't too far behind
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph cause I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy "Child, what have you been longing for?"
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"
And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a shooting star

Run, run Rudolph, Santa has to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl "Child, what would please you most to get?"
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"
And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a Saber jet

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round




[Intro]
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, an out-of-space convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 1]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be oh so good
If you'd check off my Christmas list
Boo doo bee doo

[Verse 2]
Santa honey, I want yacht and really that's
Not a lot
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa cutie, there's one thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, I'm filling my stocking with a duplex, and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 3]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
Boo doo bee doo

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
I don't mean a phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Outro]
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight




[Verse 1]
Hello Dan, it's Joe here
I hope you're keeping well
It's the 21st of December
And now they're ringing the last bells
If I get good behaviour
I'll be out of here by July
Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas Day?
Please don't let 'em cry for me

[Verse 2]
I guess the brothers are driving down from Queensland
And Stella's flying in from the coast
They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees, even more maybe
But that won't stop the roast
Who's gonna make the gravy now?
I bet it won't taste the same
Just add flour, salt, a little red wine
And don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce
For sweetness and that extra tang

[Chorus 1]
And give my love to Angus, and to Frank and Dolly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry, I screwed up this time
And look after Rita, I'll be thinking of her
Early Christmas morning when I'm standing in line

[Verse 3]
I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend
I hope he can hold his own
Do you remember the last one? What was his name again?
Ahh, just a little too much cologne
And Roger, you know I'm even gonna miss Roger
'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight

[Chorus 2]
Oh, praise the Baby Jesus, have a Merry Christmas
I'm really gonna miss it, all the treasure and the trash
And later in the evening, I can just imagine
You'll put on Junior Murvin and push the tables back

[Chorus 3]
And you'll dance with Rita, I know you really like her
Just don't hold her too close
Oh, brother, please don't stab me in the back
I didn't mean to say that, it's just my mind it plays up
Multiplies each matter, turns imagination into fact

[Chorus 4]
You know I love her badly, she's the one to save me
I'm gonna make some gravy, I'm gonna taste the fat
Ahh, tell her that I'm sorry, yeah, I love her badly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry, and kiss the sleepy children for me
You know one of these days, I'll be making gravy
I'll be making plenty, I'm gonna pay 'em all back

[Outro]
Yeah, do-do-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do




[Verse]
Ome they told me
Our newborn King to see
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King

This is to honor Him
When we come
Baby Jesus, I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King

But may I play for You
On my drum?
The Mother Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for Him
I played my best for Him

[Outro]
Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum




[Verse 1]
Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

[Refrain]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

[Refrain]
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Oh, Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights, keep shining on




It's Christmas
Baby, please come home

The snow's coming down
I'm watching it fall
Watching the people around
Baby please come home

The church bells in town
They're ringing a song
What a happy sound
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching 'em shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home

Baby please come home
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

If there was a way
I'd hold back these tears
But it's Christmas day
Baby please come home
Ohh...

Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Ohh...
Baby please come home
Baby please come home




Merry Christmas baby
Sure do treat me nice
Merry Christmas baby
Sure do treat me nice
Bought me a diamond ring for Christmas
I feel like I'm in paradise

I feel mighty fine, y'all
I've got music on my radio
Feel mighty fine, girl
I've got music on my radio, oh, oh, oh
I feel like I'm gonna kiss you
Standing beneath that mistletoe

Santa came down the chimney
Half past three, y'all
Left all them good ole presents
For my baby and for me, ha, ha, ha

Merry Christmas baby
Sure do treat me nice

You bought me all those good ole presents
I love you baby rest of my life

Merry Christmas, girl
Merry, merry, merry Christmas baby
Sure do treat me nice
Merry Christmas baby
I said you sure do treat me nice
You bought all those lovely things, yeah
I feel like I'm in paradise

I wish you a merry Christmas baby
Happy new year, ha
A merry Christams, honey
Everything here is beautiful
I love you, baby
For everything that you give me
I love you, honey...




[Verse 1]
What time is it, baby, is it that time again?
When snow will be falling, friends will be calling
You know it's time when there'll be carolers singing silent night
I love when they sing, the feeling it brings
It's warm as a fire is bright
Soon there'll be toys for good girls and boys
And reindeer are heading our way
Yes, and Santa will come down the chimney above
There's one thing I wanted to say

[Chorus]
I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas, I do

[Verse 2]
I saw a child sit with old Mr. Clause
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was
Now the old man grew cautious on how he would say
That it's the greatest gift what you could give every day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now the mistle-toes and the house of Lords
All the world seems at ease tonight
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass
Is why can't every day be so bright

[Chorus]




Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

(Silent night)
(Holy night)
(All is calm)
(All is bright)
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
(Both) Sleep in heavenly peace




[Verse 1]
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
(Ahh, ahh)
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's when those blue memories start callin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
(Ahh, ahh)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

[Bridge]
(Oooooaaaooooh
Oooooaaaooooh)

[Outro]
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
(Ahh, ahh)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)




I think I saw ol' Santa through my window Christmas eve
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe
It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that, Oh no
I know my Mom and Dad can't fly like that

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four
He stands outside my bedroom yelling 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' because
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus, no way
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus

I think my daddy sees me
Peeking from my door
But he pretends he's Santa anyway
Every year he tries to fool me
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...
No way!

So I went back to my bed and I curled up nice and tight
I stared out of my window and I looked into the night
And then, all of a sudden, through my window I could see
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me

Chorus:
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
It must've been ol' Santa Claus
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Happy 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' to you

Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside
He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh
And then ol' Santa took me up and away
Santa took me up up and away

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said
'Little boys like you should be in bed'

So I hollered 'Ho! Ho! Ho!'
And I put on Santa's hat
Then he let me hold the reins a while
We pulled up to my window
And I jumped back in my room
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile

When I woke up Christmas morning (well) it was clear and bright
My parents said my window had blown open in the night
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat
And they asked me where I got my big red hat, Yeah yeah
They asked me where I got my big red hat

Chorus

Happy Ho! Ho! Ho! to you! (18x)




Best of the season from R.E.M




[Intro]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
If there were no presents
Waiting on Santa's sleigh
What would I wish
For Christmas
And if Frosty, the Snowman
Were melting away
I would pray for hope and unity
On Christmas day

[Chorus]
If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy and peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one

[Verse 2]
If Rudolph and his reindeer
Ran into delays
I'd still hope for joy
This season, yeah
And if somehow Santa
Got lost on his way
I would try to find a way to smile
Smile on Christmas day, oh

[Chorus]
If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy and peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one, oh yeah

(Ah)




[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
"Won't see another one"
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
"They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty, Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum, you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas, your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing, "Galway Bay"
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
"I could have been someone"
Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me, babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing, "Galway Bay"
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day




Well, it's Christmas time again
Decorations are all hung by the fire
Everybody's singin', all the bells are ringing out
And it's Christmas all over again, yeah, again

Long distance relatives
Haven't seen 'em in a long, long time
Yeah, I kind of missed 'em, I just don't wanna kiss 'em, no
It's Christmas all over again, yeah, again

And all over town, little kids gonna get down
And Christmas is a rockin' time, put your body next to mine
Underneath the mistletoe we go, we go

(Hey)

Everybody's singin', all the bells are ringin' out
And it's Christmas all over again, yeah, again

And right down our block, little kids start to rock
And Christmas is a rockin' time, put your body next to mine
Underneath the mistletoe we go, we go

Merry Christmas time come and find you happy
And there by your fire, I hope you have a good one
I hope momma gets her shoppin' done

And it's a Christmas all over again
Oh, baby, it's Christmas all over again
(Oh yeah)
And it's Christmas all over again

Spoken:
Now let's see, I want a new Rickenbacker guitar
Two Fender bassmans
Chuck Berry songbooks, xylophone




Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one wish to make
A special one for you
Merry Christmas Darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmasing with you
Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But ev'ryday's a holiday
When I'm near to you
The lights on my tree
I wish you could see
I wish it ev'ry day
Logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you Merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I've just one wish on this Christmas eve
I wish I were with you
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you Merry Christmas
Happy New Year too
I've just one wish on this Christmas eve
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you




[Verse 1]
I watch the snowflakes fall
Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watching snowflakes, too
I take a walk downtown
To where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that's waiting there is

[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

[Verse 2]
I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a liitle prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is

[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

[Bridge]
This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(Bu I'm as sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me?
(Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me?)

[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve




[Verse 1]
Thinking of you
Thinking of all that you do to me
Out of the blue
All that I hope
But live without it
Sail into view
And put a light that moved right through me
It's all coming true
And now every day's like Christmas

[Chorus]
Until you, every day was ordinary, it's true
And now every day's like Christmas

[Verse 2]
All 'cos of you
All now there's angels all around me
I was down and disused
And now I can't believe you found me
Thinking of you
Thinking of all the storms we weathered
Thanks for pulling me through
I hope we'll always be together

[Chorus]
'Cause it's true
Every day before was heavy
And now every day's like Christmas

[Chorus 2]
Oh, you're just extraordinary
And all before my hopes are buried
Now my dreams are coming very true

[Bridge]
Now I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling into you

[Chorus 2]
Oh, you're just extraordinary
It's true, you make every day like Christmas

[Outro]
Oh, every day
Every day's like Christmas
Oh, every day
Every day's like Christmas
Every day
Every day's like Christmas
Every day
Every day's like Christmas




Verse 1:
The cold wind is blowin' and the streets are getting dark
I'm writin' you a letter and I don't know where to start
The bells will be ringin' Saint John the Divine
I get a little lonely every year around this time
The music plays all night in Little Italy
The lights will be going up on old Rockefeller tree
People window shopping on Fifth Avenue
All I want for Christmas is you

Chorus:
I've got to know (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Where do the lonely hearts go(Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Oh cause' nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas

Verse 2:
Things are different since you've been here last
Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past
Maybe you can bring us some hope this year
Visions of sugar plums have disappeared
Do you remember sleigh riding in the snow
And dancing all night to "Baby, Please Come Home"
Today's celebration is bittersweet
There's mothers and children in the street

Chorus:
I wanna know (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Cause' nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas

Verse 3:
I'm all grown up but I'm the same you'll see
I'm writing you this letter cause I still believe
Dear Santa I've been good this year
Can't you stay a little while with me right here

Ooooooh
I've got to know

Saxophone Instrumental

(Tell me) I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go

Oooooh, Because nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
Oooh, nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
Oooohhh, nobody ought to be
Oooh yeah on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
All alone on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Tell me I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Don't leave me alone (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
All alone  on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Tell me I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do they all go (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Nobody on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)




[Verse 1]
Who's got a beard that's long and white?
Santa's got a beard that's long and white

Who comes around on a special night?

Special Night, beard that's white

[Chorus]
Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Clause

[Verse 2]
Who wears boots and a suit of red?

Cap on head, suit that's red
Special night, beard that's white

[Chorus]
Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Clause

[Verse 3]
Who's got a big red cherry nose?
Santa's got a big red cherry nose

Who laughs this way - "HO HO HO"?

HO HO HO, cherry nose
Cap on head, suit that's red
Special night, beard that's white

[Chorus]
Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Clause

[Verse 4]
Who very soon will come our way?
Santa very soon will come our way

Eight little reindeer pull his sleigh?

[Intro]
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more, because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

[Outro]
Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord, when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord, a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord, they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord, with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord, they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord, but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord, with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us  (So praise the lord)
And love may reign once more




[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year




[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way




The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding
Ooh, ooh
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo doo-doo

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ahh, and don't look down

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong

The party's on
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
Ohh, and that's enough

We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-ohh
Christmastime




[Verse 1]
Feigning joy and surprise at the gifts we despise
Over mulled wine, with you
On the 25th day of the 12th month
The sleigh bells are in time, ringing true

[Pre-Chorus]
How we cling each noel to that snowflake's hope in hell
That it won't end

[Chorus]
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Just let them ring peace

[Verse 2]
Well, the weather is cruel
And the season of yule warms the heart
But it still hurts
You've got your career
Spend the best part of last year apart
And it still hurts

[Pre-Chorus]
So, that's why I pray, each and every Christmas day
That it won't end

[Chorus]
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Just let them ring peace

(Christmas time)
(Don't let the bells end)
(Christmas time)
(Don't let the bells end)

[Bridge]
Poised underneath the mistletoe leaf
And you're not here
You went away, upon boxing day
Now, how the hell am I going to make it into the new year?

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end (Don't let it end)
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Don't let the bells end (Just let them ring in peace)
Christmas time (C'mon, kids!)
Don't let the bells end (bells end)

Christmas time
Don't let the bells end




[Intro]
Ah, aha
Ooh, ohh
Ohh

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
(Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

[Verse 3]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year, to save me from tears (Ohh)
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Outro]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Special...
Someone...




Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Tou better watch out, better not cry, you better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Up on the housetop, reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for everyone's Christmas joys
Tito had just one desire
That he gets a new guitar
But he wants a guarantee
That it won't play out of key
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop, click, click, click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
O
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me
Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom, fast asleep
Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
We wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas,we wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year
The jackson 5 wanna wish everyboy a merry merry christmas and a groovy new year
The jackson 5 wanna wish everyboy a merry merry christmas and a groovy new year
We wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas,we wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year




[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)




I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days
Be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days
Be merry and bright
May all your Christmas' be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white




[Verse 1]
Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 2]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more nights on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams, mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep




[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 1]
Tonight, I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]
But then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 2]
I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Saxophone Solo]

[Bridge]
And then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree, yeah

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need)
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (Underneath the tree)
You're all that I need (Underneath the tree, yeah)
Underneath the tree, tonight
Oh, you're all I need
Underneath, underneath the tree




[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers & Santa]
Oh Santa, I've been waiting on you
That's funny kid, because I've been coming for you
Oh Santa, I've been killing just for fun
Well the party's over kid, because I
Because I got a bullet in my gun
A bullet in your what?

[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Santa's got a bullet in his gun
You know it, Santa's got a bullet in his gun

[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Don't shoot me, Santa Claus
I've been a clean living boy, I promise you
Did every little thing you asked me to
I can't believe the things I'm going through
Don't shoot me, Santa Claus
Well, no one else around believes me
But the children on the block they tease me
I couldn't let them off that easy

[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers & Santa]
Oh Santa, It's been a real hard year (Year)
There just ain't no getting around this, life is hard
But look at me, I turned out alright
Hey Santa, why don't we talk about it? Work it out
Believe me, this ain't what I wanted
I love all you kids, you know that
Hell, I remember when you were just 10 years old
Playing out there in the desert
Just waiting for a sip of that sweet Mojave rain

[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
In the sweet Mojave rain, the boy was on his own

[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Don't shoot me, Santa Claus
I've been a clean living boy, I promise you
Did every little thing you asked me to
I can't believe the things I'm going through
Hey, Santa Claus
Well, no one else around believes me
But the children on the block they tease me
I couldn't let them off that easy

[Bridge: Brandon Flowers]
They had it coming so why can't you see?
I couldn't turn my cheek no longer
The sun is going down and Christmas is near
Just look the other way and I'll disappear forever
Woo!

[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Don't shoot me, Santa Claus
Well, no one else around believes me!
But the children on the street they tease me
I couldn't let them off that easy

[Outro: Brandon Flowers]
Believe me
Santa
Santa




[Verse 1]
Santa Baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl, santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Baby a 54 convertible too light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the Fella's that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check out my Christmas list

[Verse 2]
Santa Baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Honey, one little thing I really need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a duplex and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line, Santa cutie
And hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

[Verse 3]
Santa Baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring - I don't mean on the phone, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonight




"Bah, humbug!" No, that's too strong
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year, ski shop
Encounter, most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!

Flashback to springtime, saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't, of course, 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No, this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
And, of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites

Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go

Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way, unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?

So on with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!

"I'm spending this one alone," he said
"Need a break; this year's been crazy."
I said, "Me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?"

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending! "

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!




Are you hanging up your stocking on the wall?
Is it time that every Santa has a ball?
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
Does he tug upon a sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best?
And she's up and rock n rolling with the rest
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now it's only just begun
What will your daddy do
When he sees your mamma kissing Santa Claus?
Ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh
Are you hinging up your socking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you rattle down the hillside
In the buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you will say
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
It's only just begun
Everybody's having fun




[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Candles burning low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols
Right outside my door

[Chorus]
All these things and more
(all these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(that's what Christmas means to me my love)

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

And ya know what I mean
I see your smiling face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
The little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

Oh yeah ha ha
I feel like running wild
(Running wild)
As anxious as a little child
Greet you neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the coming year
(Happiness in the coming year)
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

[Chorus]
All these things and more, baby
(all these things and more, baby)
Whoa
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(that's what Christmas means to me my love)
Oh baby baby

Candles burning low
Lots and lots of snow
Alright
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas choirs singing
Coo
Christmas mistletoe




[Verse 1]
The snow's coming down
I'm watching it fall
Lots of people around
Baby please come home

[Verse 2]
The church bells in town
All ringing in song
Full of happy sounds
Baby please come home

[Chorus]
They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

[Verse 3]
Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching them shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home

[Chorus]
They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

[Outro]
If there was a way
I'd hold back this tear
But it's Christmas day
Please please please please
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Please come home




Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

[Instrumental]

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

[Verse 1: Jade Thirlwall]
He might got the biggest ca-a-ar
Don't mean he can drive me wild or he can go for miles
Said he got a lot of ca-a-ash
Darling he can't buy my love, it's you I'm dreaming of

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne Pinnock & All]
They try to romance me but you got that nasty
And that's what I want (That's what I want)
So baby, baby, come and save me
Don't need those other numbers when I got my number one

[Chorus: All]
Last night I lay in bed so blue
Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you
I've tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you

[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson]
Used to get it when I wa-a-ant
You were pouring out your love, I could never get enough
Now I'm dealing with these boys
When I really need a man who can do it like I can

[Pre-Chorus: Perrie & All]
They try to romance me but you got that nasty
And that's what I want (That's what I want)

When I was a child I used to wonder
How Santa put my toys under the tree
I said, "Momma can you tell me how this can be?"
When there ain't no chimneys in the projects?
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)

Momma sat me down and said "Baby
Santa Clause does magic things
As soon as you're asleep a chimney will appear
And in the morning you will see all he brings
Don't you worry that their ain't no chimney's in the projects"
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the projects

Now I'm all grown and I see
It was the ? that got that magic dime
But Momma now I know, that you were the one
There ain't no chimneys in the projects
Not in the ghetto
Ain't no chimneys in the projects

Momma was the one
It was Momma Momma Momma




[Intro]
I gave you my heart
Merry Christmas

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
It's been a year, you know it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
Merry Christmas, I love you and I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

[Post-Chorus]
Special
Special
Special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

[Outro]
Special
Special
Special
Special




[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

[Verse 1]
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time of the year




[Verse 1]
Hey, Mr. Churchill comes over here
To say we're doing splendidly
But it's very cold out here in the snow
Marching to and from the enemy
Oh I say it's tough, I have had enough
Can you stop the cavalry?

[Verse 2]
I have had to fight, almost every night
Down throughout these centuries
That is when I say, oh yes yet again
Can you stop the cavalry?

[Chorus]
Mary Bradley waits at home
In the nuclear fall-out zone
Wish I could be dancing now
In the arms of the girl I love

[Intermission]
Dub a dub a dumb dumb
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dumb dumb dub a dub
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dub a dumb dumb
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dumb dumb dub a dub
Dub a dub a dumb
Wish I was at home for Christmas

[Verse 3]
Bang! That's another bomb on another town
While the Tsar and Jim have tea
If I get home, live to tell the tale
I'll run for all presidencies
If I get elected I'll stop - I will stop the cavalry

[Intermission]
Dub a dub a dumb dumb
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dumb dumb dub a dub
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dub a dumb dumb
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dumb dumb dub a dub
Dub a dub a dumb
Wish I was at home for Christmas

[Chorus]
Wish I could be dancing now
In the arms of the girl I love
Mary Bradley waits at home
She's been waiting two years long
Wish I was at home for Christmas




It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas

Try and imagine
A house that's not a home
Try to imagine
A Christmas all alone
That's where I'll be
Since you left me
My tears will melt the snow
What can I do
Without you, I got no place to go

It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas

It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold




[Verse 1]
Oh, my love, we've had our share of tears
Oh, my friend, we've had our hopes and fears
Oh, my friends, it's been a long hard year

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas

[Verse 2]
The moon and stars seem awful cold and bright
Let's hope the snow will make this Christmas right
My friend, the world will share this special night

[Pre-Chorus]
Because it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one night

[Chorus]
Thank God it's Christmas, yeah
Thank God it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Can it be Christmas?
Let it be Christmas
Every day

[Verse 3]
Oh, my love, we live in troubled days
Oh, my friend, we have the strangest ways
All my friends on this one day of days
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one day

[Outro]
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
Ooh yeah
Thank God it's Christmas
Yes, yes, yes, yes, it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas
For one day
A very merry Christmas to you all




[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Verse 1]
Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Verse 2]
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed and cover up your head
Because Santa Claus comes tonight

[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Verse 3]
He doesn't care if you're a rich or poor boy
He loves you just the same
Santa knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Chorus]
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

[Outro]
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
It's Christmas morn again
Peace on Earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Cause Santa Claus comes tonight




[Intro (spoken)]
Jimmy, I just came back from a lovely trip along the milky way
I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old, dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me
Now Santa is a busy man, he has no time for play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready, his reindeers and his sleigh

[Chorus]
You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list, he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out whose naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1]
He sees when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
Oh, you'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Bridge]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too -

[Chorus]
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 2]
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland all around the Christmas tree

[Chorus]
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Outro]
Santa Claus is coming to town




[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
"Won't see another one"
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
"They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty, Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum, you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas, your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing, "Galway Bay"
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
"I could have been someone"
Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me, babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing, "Galway Bay"
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day




[Verse 1]
Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall
It's the time when every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer
Does a ton up on his sleigh
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day

[Hook]
So here it is, Merry Xmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best
Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest

[Hook]

What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissing Santa Claus A-ha

[Verse 3]
Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made
When you land upon your head
Then you bin slayed

[Hook x3]




[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, mmm
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on your troubles will be out of sight, yeah

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on your troubles will be miles away, oh

[Verse 3]
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore, ah
Faithful friends who are dear to us
They gather near to us once more, ooh

[Chorus]
Through the years we all will be together and
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough, oh yeah, oh
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Faithful friends who are dear to us
They gather near to us once more, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Through the years we all will be together and
If the fates allow, oh yeah
But till then we'll have to muddle through somehow, oh yeah, oh, oh
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now, ooh yeah, oh, ooh




Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!"

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!"




[Verse 1]
Last December when we were together
I remember prayin' it was forever
Didn't know, like the snow, our love would melt away
Spring went by and then the summer started
Mid-July, I was still brokenhearted
Autumn leaves have left the trees, but these feelings still remain
Seems I'm not forgetting you as quickly as I wanted to
Now winter's on its way

[Chorus]
Yeah, at Christmas, I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me, evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas, I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be
C'est la vie
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas

[Verse 2]
I know moving on is never easy
Wish my heart could change like the seasons
Someone send a happy end to my winter's tale
Now I'm building me a great big snowman
When I hold him, we'll be two hearts frozen
All alone, I'll keep him cold, to make sure that he stays
I am trying my very best
But now I face the hardest test
As I've no festive cheer

[Chorus]
Yeah, at Christmas, I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me, evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas, I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be
C'est la vie
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at--

[Bridge]
Can't help but think about you when I'm all alone
Each time I hear Sinatra on my radio
I'd be in Christmas heaven if only you were present
Maybe you're somewhere out there on your way to me

[Chorus]
Yeah, at Christmas, I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me, evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas, I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be
C'est la vie
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas
Oh, at Christmas, oh wo-o-oah, whoo
Yeah, I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas
