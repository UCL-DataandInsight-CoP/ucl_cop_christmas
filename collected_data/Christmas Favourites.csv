[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So it's Christmas once more

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away

Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

With a note saying ""I love you"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)

Someday soon we all will be together if the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

People shouted ""let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees even more maybe
But that won't stop the roast
Who's gonna make the gravy now?
I bet it won't taste the same
Just add flour salt a little red wine
And don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce
For sweetness and that extra tang

[Chorus 1]
And give my love to Angus and to Frank and Dolly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry I screwed up this time
And look after Rita I'll be thinking of her
Early Christmas morning when I'm standing in line

[Verse 3]
I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend
I hope he can hold his own
Do you remember the last one? What was his name again?
Ahh just a little too much cologne
And Roger you know I'm even gonna miss Roger
'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight

[Chorus 2]
Oh praise the Baby Jesus have a Merry Christmas
I'm really gonna miss it all the treasure and the trash
And later in the evening I can just imagine
You'll put on Junior Murvin and push the tables back

[Chorus 3]
And you'll dance with Rita I know you really like her
Just don't hold her too close
Oh brother please don't stab me in the back
I didn't mean to say that it's just my mind it plays up
Multiplies each matter turns imagination into fact

[Chorus 4]
You know I love her badly she's the one to save me
I'm gonna make some gravy I'm gonna taste the fat
Ahh tell her that I'm sorry yeah I love her badly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry and kiss the sleepy children for me
You know one of these days I'll be making gravy
I'll be making plenty I'm gonna pay 'em all back

[Outro]
Yeah do-do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do

Ome they told me
Our newborn King to see
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King

This is to honor Him
When we come
Baby Jesus I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King

But may I play for You
On my drum?
The Mother Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for Him
I played my best for Him

Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum

[Verse 1]
Christmas night another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

[Refrain]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

[Refrain]
Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Light up the fireworks in me

The snow's coming down
I'm watching it fall
Watching the people around
Baby please come home

The church bells in town
They're ringing a song
What a happy sound
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching 'em shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home

Baby please come home
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

If there was a way
I'd hold back these tears

What time is it baby is it that time again?
When snow will be falling friends will be calling
You know it's time when there'll be carolers singing silent night

Soon there'll be toys for good girls and boys
And reindeer are heading our way
Yes and Santa will come down the chimney above
There's one thing I wanted to say

I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas I do

Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was

That it's the greatest gift what you could give every day

I think I saw ol' Santa through my window Christmas eve
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe
It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that Oh no
I know my Mom and Dad can't fly like that

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four
He stands outside my bedroom yelling 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' because
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus no way
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus

I think my daddy sees me
Peeking from my door
But he pretends he's Santa anyway
Every year he tries to fool me
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...
No way!

So I went back to my bed and I curled up nice and tight
I stared out of my window and I looked into the night
And then all of a sudden through my window I could see
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me

Chorus:
Santa Claus Santa Claus
It must've been ol' Santa Claus
Santa Claus Santa Claus
Happy 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' to you

Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside
He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh
And then ol' Santa took me up and away
Santa took me up up and away

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said
'Little boys like you should be in bed'

So I hollered 'Ho! Ho! Ho!'
And I put on Santa's hat
Then he let me hold the reins a while
We pulled up to my window
And I jumped back in my room
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile

When I woke up Christmas morning (well) it was clear and bright
My parents said my window had blown open in the night
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat
And they asked me where I got my big red hat Yeah yeah
They asked me where I got my big red hat

Chorus

Happy Ho! Ho! Ho! to you! (18x)

And dreamed about you

You were pretty Queen of New York City

They howled out for more

All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

Were singing 'Galway Bay'
