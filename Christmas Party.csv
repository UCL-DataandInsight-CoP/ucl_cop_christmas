[Intro]
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Outro]
Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us  (So praise the lord)
And love may reign once more

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be if he won't be here)
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feigning joy and surprise at the gifts we despise
Over mulled wine with you
On the 25th day of the 12th month
The sleigh bells are in time ringing true

[Pre-Chorus]
How we cling each noel to that snowflake's hope in hell
That it won't end

[Chorus]
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Just let them ring peace

[Verse 2]
Well the weather is cruel
And the season of yule warms the heart
But it still hurts
You've got your career
Spend the best part of last year apart
And it still hurts

[Pre-Chorus]
So that's why I pray each and every Christmas day
That it won't end

[Chorus]
Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Just let them ring peace

(Christmas time)
(Don't let the bells end)

Poised underneath the mistletoe leaf
And you're not here
You went away upon boxing day
Now how the hell am I going to make it into the new year?

Don't let the bells end (Don't let it end)

Ah aha
Ooh ohh
Ohh

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
(Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special oh)
Oh oh baby

[Verse 3]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year to save me from tears (Ohh)
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Outro]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone I'll give it to someone special
Special...

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Tou better watch out better not cry you better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for everyone's Christmas joys
Tito had just one desire
That he gets a new guitar
But he wants a guarantee
That it won't play out of key
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop click click click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
O
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me
Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmaswe wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year
The jackson 5 wanna wish everyboy a merry merry christmas and a groovy new year
The jackson 5 wanna wish everyboy a merry merry christmas and a groovy new year
We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmaswe wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year

[Verse 1]
Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 1]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days untill you coming home
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep

""Bah humbug!"" No that's too strong
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year ski shop
Encounter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!

Flashback to springtime saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't of course 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
And of course I am excited
Tonight's the night but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks no party lights
It's Christmas Eve gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites

Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go

Forget it it's cold it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?

So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!

""I'm spending this one alone"" he said
""Need a break; this year's been crazy.""
I said ""Me too but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending! ""

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!

Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now

Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you rattle down the hillside
In the buggy you have made?

Look to the future now

So here it is Merry Christmas

When there ain't no chimneys in the projects?

Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)

Momma sat me down and said ""Baby
Santa Clause does magic things
As soon as you're asleep a chimney will appear
And in the morning you will see all he brings
Don't you worry that their ain't no chimney's in the projects""
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the projects

Now I'm all grown and I see
It was the ? that got that magic dime

Tell me baby do you recognize me?

Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away

Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears

I remember prayin' it was forever
Didn't know like the snow our love would melt away

Seems I'm not forgetting you as quickly as I wanted to
Now winter's on its way

Wish my heart could change like the seasons

When I hold him we'll be two hearts frozen
All alone I'll keep him cold to make sure that he stays
I am trying my very best
But now I face the hardest test
As I've no festive cheer

[Chorus]
Yeah at Christmas I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be
C'est la vie
Yeah I've spent all year wishing you were here at--

[Bridge]
Can't help but think about you when I'm all alone
Each time I hear Sinatra on my radio
I'd be in Christmas heaven if only you were present
Maybe you're somewhere out there on your way to me

[Chorus]
Yeah at Christmas I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be
C'est la vie
Yeah I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas
Oh at Christmas oh wo-o-oah whoo
Yeah I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas

Bought me a diamond ring for Christmas
