[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be if he won't be here)
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer

With you shawty with you
With you shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July

Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh ho the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Scott]
I’ve heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music do you?
Well it goes like this
The fourth the fifth the minor fall the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 2: Avi]
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 3: Kirstin]
Well baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a vict'ry march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 4: Mitch]
Well maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it’s not a cry that you hear at night
It’s not somebody who's seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing

Presents what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

Tonight I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday

You're all I need
Underneath the tree

Underneath the tree

I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

We should be singing Christmas songs
Instead of shouting all night long like we do
We keep fighting in the street
When we should be home wrapped in the sheets
Putting presents underneath the tree for me and you

Of breaking up and making up

So don't give up no

Baby all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

Everyday finds a way to make me think about you
Like today when we were picking out the tree without you
I can't believe it's been so long

'Bout the boat that you built but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears

Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

Another year has passed and now it's time for buying the presents
I even got you one forgetting you're not gonna get it
I can't believe it's been so long
This time around we'll try to smile 'cause we're sick of tears
Most days are easy now but it gets hard this time of year
I can't believe you're really gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we miss you like hell all the stories that you'd tell
'Bout the boat that you built but never got to sail
I don't know whether I should cry or I should smile through my tears

Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still
Wild and free I've got so many memories
Soon time too will take it all of 'em from me
Gone don't always mean that you disappear
'Cause inside all of us you're still here

Sail that boat into the red horizon
Those years lost I'd tell you all about 'em

I really can't stay (Baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But I can call you a ride)
This evening has been (I'm so glad that you dropped in)
So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise)
My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait what are you still livin' home for?)
So really I'd better scurry (Your driver his name is Murray)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh we're both adults so who's keepin' score?)
What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice)
If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice)
Ooh you really know how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To cast a spell (One look at you and then I fell)
I ought to say ""No no no sir"" (Then you really ought to go go go)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (Well Murray he just pulled up outside)

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson John Legend & Both]
Oh I really can't stay
(I understand baby)
Baby it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I simply should go (Text me when you get home)
Oh I'm supposed to say no (Mm I guess that's respectable)
This welcome has been (I've been lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (But you better go before it storms)
My sister will be suspicious (Well gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Oh he loves my music baby I'm sure)
My gossipy neighbor is vicious (I'm a genie tell me what your wish is)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Oh that's somethin' we should probably explore)
I've got to get home (Oh baby I'm well aware)
Say lend me a coat (Oh keep it girl I don't care)
You've really been grand (I feel it when you touch my hands)
But don't you see? (I want you to stay it's not up to me)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Well they can talk but what do they know?)
At least there will be plenty implied (Oh let them mind their business and go-)
Uh ma'am I really can't stay

Baby just go
It's cold baby
It's cold baby
But ooh I don't wanna go

I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow

We’re going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

And I wanna thank you baby
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas

[Pre-Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Bridge: Gwen & Blake]
I never thought I’d find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oooh (thank you baby)

[Outro: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days may your days may your days
Be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know

Be merry and bright
May all your Christmas' be white

So now we start the Christmas caroling

We will hang our stockings for you and one for me

Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 2]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more nights on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep

And pretend that he is Parson Brown

I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Oh mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no no no
Aw baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see no no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday

The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together

Bells are ringing it's time to scream and shout
And everybody's playing 'cause schools out
Celebrating the special times we shared
Happiness 'cause love is in the air

[Verse 1]
It ain't even cold outside not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things hey

[Verse 2]
Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No no no downtown)
Even though it's 100 degrees gotta get out
Ain't no ice or no chills
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

[Chorus]
Hey yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things hey

[Bridge]
Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

[Chorus]
Hey yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Dear Santa it's me Ariana

Tomorrow he's flying away away from me

I don't need another gift I just have one wish
This year can you...

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain

Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow let it snow in California

[Verse 2]
Dear Santa what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away

Won't you find a way?

Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest of the people
Of the east and the west?
And maybe every once in a while
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile

It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a boy one day
That wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me

I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?
With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snowing
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
This love will grow in
Than to live again
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

Let it snow let it snow let it snow

How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that'll make them ring is the carol that you'll sing
Right within your heart

[Chorus 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
And the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float

To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

’Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

Winter's on the wind
Sings familiar melodies
Chill starts setting in
Silver bells are casting spells
It all comes back again
Lay your troubles down
Let me hold you

Now all the signs appear
The Christmas trees the memories
They bring this time of year
Ghosts of winters past
Come in and whisper in your ear
Don't listen to a word they've told you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

It's only you and me
The world outside is frozen white
I know it's hard to see
I'll be your candle
Be your light
Be anything you need
Star above the night to guide you

To find the highest bow
Hang up your regrets and
Let them fade into the sound
The angel choirs and roaring fires
Magic lost and found
Love is all around
Let it find you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

Through the frightful weather
I will hold you tight
We'll stay warm together
This December night
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
Now I know you've faced the cold alone before
But you don't have to face the cold alone no more
Because I'll keep you warm...

Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have a wish to make
A special one for you

Merry Christmas Darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmasing with you
Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But everyday's a holiday
When I'm near to you
Oh the lights I wish you could see
I wish it every day

Logs on the fire fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas Darling)
Happy New Year too
I have just one wish on this Christmas Eve (On this Christmas Eve)
I wish I were with you

[Instrumental Break]

Logs on the fire fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas darling)
Happy New Year too
I have just one wish on this Christmas Eve (On this Christmas Eve)

[Verse 1]
It's almost midnight where you lay your head
But I'm calling numbers buying plane tickets and bed
Every channel on the TV it's a wonderful life
I don't feel so wonderful on this cold winter night

[Chorus]
I missed Thanksgiving missed a birthday or two
Didn't make St. Valentines but I was thinking of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me Christmas without you

[Verse 2]
Ooh the snow is on the ground
The day's getting colder I'm coming home now
So go ahead light the fire turn that Christmas tree on
Because I've been missing you so much that I wrote you this song
Yes I did

[Chorus]
I missed Thanksgiving missed a birthday or two
Didn't make St. Valentines but I was thinking of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me Christmas without you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me Christmas without you

[Bridge]
Oh the presents wrapped and 'Jingle Bells' on the radio
I'm turning down the street there's no place I'd rather go
Every holiday oh you feel the same
Except for the ones when I'm with you

[Chorus]
I missed Thanksgiving I missed a birthday or two
I didn't make St. Valentines but I was thinking of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
It's only one thing that kills me Christmas without you

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

To kids from one to ninety-two

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

[Verse 1]
Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall
It's the time when every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer
Does a ton up on his sleigh
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day

[Hook]
So here it is Merry Xmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best
Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest

[Hook]

What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissing Santa Claus A-ha

[Verse 3]
Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made
When you land upon your head
Then you bin slayed

I remember the first time I made Christmas cookies at Aunt Mimi's
Me and my cousin Shock stayed up all night to put the icing on
And then everybody came over 'cause Mimi cooked and baked pies
And all my mom and dad brought was two gallons of ice cream
That's what I remember about Christmas

Take all the boxes wrapped up for almost a year
Let's have a party and all get together here
Dance up a storm underneath all the glitter and snow
Lookin' so good hangin' out with the mistletoe
Hang a string of lights
Hang another string of lights
Hang a string of lights
Watch 'em light up and light up
Shining and hanging across with the real Benson bulbs
On the tree on the house on the side of the door
Colors and lights come alive when they're all plugged in
And then I start thinkin' when one starts blinkin'
They all start blinkin'
Hang a string of lights
Hang another string of lights
Hang a string of lights
Watch 'em light up and light up
