Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And so I'm offering this simple phrase

Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh ho the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

[Instrumental]

T's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the Five and Ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots

I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful what's your hurry?
Father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think - Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat your hair looks swell

I ought to say no no no sir - Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ah but it's cold outside

I simply must go - But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no - But baby it's cold outside
This welcome has been - How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out that window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious - God your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon the tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Ooh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before

I got to get home - But baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand
Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that hold out
Ah but it's cold outside
Oh baby it's cold outside
Oh baby it's cold outside

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
That he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Thumpetty thump thump thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump over the hills of snow
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin' ""Catch me if you can""
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment
When he heard him holler ""Stop""
Because ol' Frosty the snowman he had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day I'll be back again some day
I'll be back again some day""

[Verse 2]
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board so please be careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Verse 3]
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
So cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Bridge]
They call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours

[Chorus]
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night

[Closing]
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours

[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 1]
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
No I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
There upon the fireplace
Cause Santa he won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day


[Hook]
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Girl what can I do?
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 2]
And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
Won't you please bring my baby to me...

[Chorus]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
No I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
More that you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...
Is you...

To find our Christmasland

Santa buddy a '65 convertible too steel blue
I'll wait up for you dude
Santa buddy and hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the hotties that I never kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'd check off my Christmas list

Santa pally I wanna yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an sweetie all year
Santa buddy so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa buddy one thing that I really do need the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa pally so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa buddy fill my stocking with Canucks tix for kicks
Throw me on the first line
Santa baby so hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Mercedes
I really I do believe in you
Now let's see if you believe in me

Santa poppy forgot to mention one little thing cha-ching
No I don't mean as a loan
Santa buddy so hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Oh hurry down the chimney tonight

City sidewalks busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Strings of streetlights even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear
Silver bells silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Silver bells silver bells
Soon it will be Christmas Day

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the north pole to spend a holiday

I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me so

You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Then kids in Girl and Boyland will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh so

You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy-land all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flock by night
And see a bright new shining star
And hear a choir sing
The music seem to come from afar

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
And find no place to borne she child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Peace on earth can it be

Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can

I pray my wish will come true
For my child and your child too
He'll see the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace live in peace again

Peace on earth can it be
