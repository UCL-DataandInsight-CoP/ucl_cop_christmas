What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary
Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding
Good Christian fear for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
So bring Him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary

The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing
But I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember a worst December
Just you watch those icicles fall
What do I care if those icicles fall
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat off with my glove
Who needs an overcoat I'm burning with love

My heart's on fire and the fire gets higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm
