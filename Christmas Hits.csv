[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

[Verse 2]
Oh I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you
You baby

[Bridge]
Oh all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah oh oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you baby (Ah oh ah oh)
All I want for Christmas is you baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you baby (All I really want baby ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you baby (All I want all I really want is you)

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be if he won't be here)
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Man it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Oh mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no no no
Aw baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see no no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice;
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Cause Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

T's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the Five and Ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart right within your heart

Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!

I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus (kissing kissing Santa Claus)
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep

Then I saw mommy tickle tickle (tickle tickle Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

In a one-horse open sleigh O
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say

He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day

So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in

Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Down where the sea and city meet

There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's december it
And reassemble it (oh yeah)

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Verse:
At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?

With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Pre-Chorus:
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness

Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

Bridge:
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow and
They believe again

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple try to stop
Come on Melly-pops

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
Pumpkin pie anyone?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
This is so corny
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Wow I am in the most almighty Christmas groove
I haven't had this much fun
Since ""Two little boys"" was number one
If my friends could see me now
How do I look?
Ridiculous
You little tease
A dance Kimberley?

I do love a nice sax break
Yeah me too Kim but let's wait till the record's over
Kim do you think our love will last forever?

Couple of years maybe?
No
Do you think we'll make it to the end of the record?
How long is that - exactly?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
All together now
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Excuse me can I sing something now?
Get lost Griff!
Well that's nice...

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Root beer anyone?
Later we'll have pumpkin pie

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home

Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's

Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

Five more on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own

[VERSE]
I'll hang stockings by the fire
Take peppermint canes out the cupboard
Up to the attic a box full of lights
So much more we’ve left to discover

[PRE-Chorus]
Ribbons all entangled in the garland
Mistletoe and angel's wings
Might be here for a little bit but darling
If it's with you it’s okay with me

[Chorus]
Oh do you know what's got me feeling fine?
It's the two of us
And Christmastime
There ain't nothing else
That brings us to life
Quite like ringing bells
And Christmastime

[VERSE 2]
Outside's a caroling choir
The snow is lined around the window
It's cold and baby we're tired
Wrap ourselves up head to toe

[PRE-Chorus]
Listen for the reindeer on the rooftop
He knows who's been good this year
All the elves are on vacation from the workshop
It’s almost here

[Chorus]
Oh do you know what’s got me feeling fine?
It's the two of us
And Christmastime
There ain’t nothing else
That brings us to life
Quite like ringing bells
And Christmastime

[BRIDGE]
Only Christmastime is like this
Everybody's filled with cheer
I wish we could stop our watches
And keep all the magic here

[Chorus]
Oh do you know what's got me feeling fine?
It's the two of us
And Christmastime
There ain’t nothing else
That brings us to life
Quite like ringing bells
And Christmastime

[Verse 1]
Oh Mr Kringle I'm soon gonna jingle
The bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everyone's waiting for the man with the bag
Cause Christmas is coming again

He's got a sleighful it's not gonna stay full
He's got stuff to drop at every stop on the way
Everyone's waiting for the man with the bag
Cause Christmas is coming again

He'll be here with the answers to the prayers
That you made through the year
You'll get yours if you've done
Everything you should extra special good

He'll make this December one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again

[Verse 2]
Oh Mr Cringle I'm soon gonna jingle

He'll make this December the one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waiting they're all congregating
Waiting for the man with the bag waiting for the man with the bag

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day
