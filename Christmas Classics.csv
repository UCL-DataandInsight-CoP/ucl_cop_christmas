[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" We'll say ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Over the ground lies the mantle of light
A heaven of diamond in the lovely night
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then give him a name and call him Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" And then we'll say ""No man""
But now you can do the job whenever you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream sittin' by the fire
To face unafraid all the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking walking in a winter wonderland

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo-hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop pop pop

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
As they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fires gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says let it snow let it snow let it snow

Let it snow!

Oooooh wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says let it snow let it snow let it snow

I don't care!

The weather outside is frightful
But that fire is mmm-delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow let it snow let it snow!

Let it snow!

When we finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you'll only hold me yight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

You're a monster Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole

You're a vile one Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile

[Verse 4]
You're a foul one Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows and I quote:
""Stink. Stank. Stunk.""

[Verse 5]
You're a rotter Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled-up knots

[Verse 6]
You nauseate me Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super-naus
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss Mr. Grinch
You're a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce

Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

Come a little closer children I've got a story to tell
(oh gee)
It's about a man you've heard of and I knew him well
(How well?)

He was born on a cold winter's morning
And went on to gain great fame
But may I begin my story
And refer to him by name?
(Please do)

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul (ooooh)
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman made the children smile they say
And were they surprised when he rolled his eyes
And he came to life that day!

There must of been some magic
In that ol' silk cap they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal!
Were they surprised when he rolled his eyes and he came to life that day!

(But Uncle Jimmy you didn't finish your story.)
I know I just paused to catch my breath
(What happened to frosty when he came to life that day?)
Well he got in a lot of trouble you see?

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
(Where'd he go?)
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there and around the square
Sayin' ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler ""Stop!""

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again someday!

Look at that Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump

Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees sway
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say Merry Christmas to you

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""You Hoo""
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noël noël noël noël

Born is the king of israel

Hark the herald angels sing ""glory to the newborn king
Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim christ is born in bethlehem""
Hark the herald angels sing glory to the new-born king

Pray for the other ones

There's a world outside your window

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary

Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails spear shall pierce Him through
The Cross be borne for me for you;
Hail hail the Word made flesh
The Babe the Son of Mary

So bring him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him
Raise raise the song on high
The Virgin sing her lullaby:
Joy joy for Christ is born
The Babe the Son of Mary

(Chorus)
Oh the rising of the sun and the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ sweet singing in the choir

The holly bears a blossom as white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to be our sweet savior

(Chorus)
The holly bears a berry as red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to do poor sinners good

(Chorus)
The holly bears a prickle as sharp as any thorn
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ on Christmas Day in the morn

(Chorus)
The holly bears a bark as bitter as any gall
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ for to redeem us all

So very nice (I'll hold your hands they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat your hair looks swell)
I ought to say ""No no no sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But baby you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

On the ninth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five gold rings
(Five golden rings)
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtledoves
And a partridge in a pear tree
On the tenth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five gold rings
(Five golden rings)
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtledoves
And a partridge in a pear tree
On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love sent to me
I sent eleven pipers piping
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five gold rings
(Five golden rings)
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtledoves
And a partridge in a pear tree
On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Twelve drummers drumming
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five gold rings
(Five golden rings)
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtledoves
And a partridge in a pear tree
And a partridge in a pear tree

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day
