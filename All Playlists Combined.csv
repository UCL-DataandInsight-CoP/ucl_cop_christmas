[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" We'll say ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Over the ground lies the mantle of light
A heaven of diamond in the lovely night
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then give him a name and call him Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" And then we'll say ""No man""
But now you can do the job whenever you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream sittin' by the fire
To face unafraid all the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking walking in a winter wonderland

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo-hoo
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop pop pop

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
As they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fires gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says let it snow let it snow let it snow

Let it snow!

Oooooh wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says let it snow let it snow let it snow

I don't care!

The weather outside is frightful
But that fire is mmm-delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow let it snow let it snow!

Let it snow!

When we finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you'll only hold me yight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow!

You're a monster Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole

You're a vile one Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile

[Verse 4]
You're a foul one Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows and I quote:
""Stink. Stank. Stunk.""

[Verse 5]
You're a rotter Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled-up knots

[Verse 6]
You nauseate me Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super-naus
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss Mr. Grinch
You're a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce

Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

Come a little closer children I've got a story to tell
(oh gee)
It's about a man you've heard of and I knew him well
(How well?)

He was born on a cold winter's morning
And went on to gain great fame
But may I begin my story
And refer to him by name?
(Please do)

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul (ooooh)
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman made the children smile they say
And were they surprised when he rolled his eyes
And he came to life that day!

There must of been some magic
In that ol' silk cap they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal!
Were they surprised when he rolled his eyes and he came to life that day!

(But Uncle Jimmy you didn't finish your story.)
I know I just paused to catch my breath
(What happened to frosty when he came to life that day?)
Well he got in a lot of trouble you see?

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
(Where'd he go?)
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there and around the square
Sayin' ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler ""Stop!""

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again someday!

Look at that Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump

Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees sway
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way to say Merry Christmas to you

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""You Hoo""
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing
Ring ting tingle-ing too
Come on it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noël noël noël noël

Born is the king of israel

Hark the herald angels sing ""glory to the newborn king
Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim christ is born in bethlehem""
Hark the herald angels sing glory to the new-born king

Pray for the other ones

There's a world outside your window

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary

Why lies he in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails spear shall pierce Him through
The Cross be borne for me for you;
Hail hail the Word made flesh
The Babe the Son of Mary

So bring him incense gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him
Raise raise the song on high
The Virgin sing her lullaby:
Joy joy for Christ is born
The Babe the Son of Mary

(Chorus)
Oh the rising of the sun and the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ sweet singing in the choir

The holly bears a blossom as white as lily flower
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to be our sweet savior

(Chorus)
The holly bears a berry as red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to do poor sinners good

(Chorus)
The holly bears a prickle as sharp as any thorn
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ on Christmas Day in the morn

(Chorus)
The holly bears a bark as bitter as any gall
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ for to redeem us all

So very nice (I'll hold your hands they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat your hair looks swell)
I ought to say ""No no no sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But baby you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five gold rings

Four calling birds
Three French hens

Twelve drummers drumming
Eleven pipers piping

[Verse 1: Shane MacGowan]
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat off with my glove
Who needs an overcoat I'm burning with love

My heart's on fire and the fire gets higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I've got to go away (Baby I'm cool with that)

This evening has been (Been hoping you get home safe)

So very nice (I'm glad you had a real good time)

My mother will start to worry (Call her so she knows that you're coming)

Father will be pacing the floor (Better get your car a-humming)

So really I'd better scurry (No rush)

Should I use the front or back door? (Which one are you pulling towards more?)

The neighbors might think (That you're a real nice girl)

What is this drink? (Pomegranate La Croix)

I wish I knew how (Maybe I can help you out)

To break this spell (I don't know what you're talking about)

I ought to say no no no (you reserve the right to say no)

At least I'm gonna say that I tried (you reserve the right to say no)

I really can't stay (...Well you don't have to)

Baby it's cold outside

I've got to get home (Do you know how to get there from here)

Say where is my coat (I'll go and grab it my dear)

You've really been grand (We'll have to do this again)

Yes I agree (How 'bout the Cheesecake Factory?)

We're bound to be talking tomorrow (Text me at your earliest convenience)

At least I have been getting that vibe (Unless I catch pneumonia and die)

I'll be on my way (Thanks for the great night)

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees O hear the angels voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend

He knows our need to our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever
His power and glory evermore proclaim

With a note saying I love you I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's makin' a list
Checkin' it twice
Gonna find out
Who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Oh yes he is

The kids in girl and boyland
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland
All around the Christmas tree

So you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town

She gives me everything I could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home

She can make angels
Seen it with my own eyes
You gotta be careful when you've got good love
'Cause then angels will just keep on multiplying

Aw but you're so busy changing the world

Maybe this year love will appear
Deeper than ever before

And maybe forgiveness will ask us to call
Someone we love someone we've lost
For reasons we can’t quite recall
Maybe this Christmas

Maybe there’ll be an open door
Maybe the star that shone before
Will shine once more oh

And maybe this Christmas will find us at last
In heavenly peace grateful at least
For the love we've been shown in the past oh
Maybe this Christmas maybe this Christmas

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Take a look in the Five and Ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful what's your hurry?
Father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful please don't hurry
Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think - Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat your hair looks swell

I ought to say no no no sir - Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ah but it's cold outside

I simply must go - But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no - But baby it's cold outside
This welcome has been - How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out that window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious - God your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon the tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Ooh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before

I got to get home - But baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand
Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that hold out
Ah but it's cold outside
Oh baby it's cold outside
Oh baby it's cold outside

Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Dashing through the snow (we are dashing)
In a one horse open sleigh (one horse sleigh)
O'er the fields we go (o'er the fields we go we go)
Laughing all the way (all the way)
Bells on bobtail ring

Making spirits bright

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling ring ting tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy yap giddy yap giddy yap let's go let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap giddy yap giddy yap it's grand just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy yap giddy yap giddy yap let's go let's look at the show

Sleigh ride together with you
Sleigh ride together with you

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
That he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Thumpetty thump thump thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump over the hills of snow
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin' ""Catch me if you can""
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment
When he heard him holler ""Stop""
Because ol' Frosty the snowman he had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day I'll be back again some day
I'll be back again some day""

O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born

O night divine
O night
O night divine

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
O night divine O night when Christ was born

O night divine
O night
O night divine

[Verse 1]
Stockings are hung with care
As children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now but not done hoping

[Verse 2]
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board so please be careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Verse 3]
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
So cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Bridge]
They call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours

[Chorus]
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night

[Closing]
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours for the taking
Call it the season of giving
I'm here I'm yours

[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 1]
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
No I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
There upon the fireplace
Cause Santa he won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day


[Hook]
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Girl what can I do?
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

[Verse 2]
And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
Won't you please bring my baby to me...

[Chorus]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
No I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
More that you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...
Is you...

Waiting there for you

There’ll be toys and some mistletoe
All the things that you loved as a child

City sidewalks busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Strings of streetlights even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear
Silver bells silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Silver bells silver bells

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the north pole to spend a holiday

I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me so

You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Then kids in Girl and Boyland will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Now Santa is a busy man He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh so

You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy-land all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out you better not cry
Better not pout I'm telling you why

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flock by night
And see a bright new shining star
And hear a choir sing
The music seem to come from afar

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
And find no place to borne she child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Ah aha
Ooh ohh
Ohh

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
(Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special oh)
Oh oh baby

[Verse 3]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave me away)

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone I'll give it to someone special
Special...

Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

Oh a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Outro]
Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Hello Dan it's Joe here
I hope you're keeping well
It's the 21st of December
And now they're ringing the last bells
If I get good behaviour
I'll be out of here by July
Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas Day?
Please don't let 'em cry for me

[Verse 2]
I guess the brothers are driving down from Queensland
And Stella's flying in from the coast
They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees even more maybe
But that won't stop the roast
Who's gonna make the gravy now?
I bet it won't taste the same
Just add flour salt a little red wine
And don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce
For sweetness and that extra tang

[Chorus 1]
And give my love to Angus and to Frank and Dolly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry I screwed up this time
And look after Rita I'll be thinking of her
Early Christmas morning when I'm standing in line

[Verse 3]
I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend
I hope he can hold his own
Do you remember the last one? What was his name again?
Ahh just a little too much cologne
And Roger you know I'm even gonna miss Roger
'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight

[Chorus 2]
Oh praise the Baby Jesus have a Merry Christmas
I'm really gonna miss it all the treasure and the trash
And later in the evening I can just imagine
You'll put on Junior Murvin and push the tables back

[Chorus 3]
And you'll dance with Rita I know you really like her
Just don't hold her too close
Oh brother please don't stab me in the back
I didn't mean to say that it's just my mind it plays up
Multiplies each matter turns imagination into fact

[Chorus 4]
You know I love her badly she's the one to save me
I'm gonna make some gravy I'm gonna taste the fat
Ahh tell her that I'm sorry yeah I love her badly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry and kiss the sleepy children for me
You know one of these days I'll be making gravy
I'll be making plenty I'm gonna pay 'em all back

You should be here with me
Baby please come home

Baby please come home
Baby please come home

They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

If there was a way
I'd hold back these tears
But it's Christmas day
Baby please come home
Ohh...

Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Ohh...
Baby please come home
Baby please come home

[Verse 1]
What time is it baby is it that time again?
When snow will be falling friends will be calling
You know it's time when there'll be carolers singing silent night
I love when they sing the feeling it brings
It's warm as a fire is bright
Soon there'll be toys for good girls and boys
And reindeer are heading our way
Yes and Santa will come down the chimney above
There's one thing I wanted to say

[Chorus]
I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas I do

[Verse 2]
I saw a child sit with old Mr. Clause
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was
Now the old man grew cautious on how he would say
That it's the greatest gift what you could give every day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now the mistle-toes and the house of Lords
All the world seems at ease tonight
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass
Is why can't every day be so bright

I think I saw ol' Santa through my window Christmas eve
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe
It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that Oh no
I know my Mom and Dad can't fly like that

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four
He stands outside my bedroom yelling 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' because
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus no way
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus

I think my daddy sees me
Peeking from my door
But he pretends he's Santa anyway
Every year he tries to fool me
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...
No way!

So I went back to my bed and I curled up nice and tight
I stared out of my window and I looked into the night
And then all of a sudden through my window I could see
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me

Chorus:
Santa Claus Santa Claus
It must've been ol' Santa Claus
Santa Claus Santa Claus
Happy 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' to you

Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside
He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh
And then ol' Santa took me up and away
Santa took me up up and away

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said
'Little boys like you should be in bed'

So I hollered 'Ho! Ho! Ho!'
And I put on Santa's hat
Then he let me hold the reins a while
We pulled up to my window
And I jumped back in my room
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile

When I woke up Christmas morning (well) it was clear and bright
My parents said my window had blown open in the night
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat
And they asked me where I got my big red hat Yeah yeah
They asked me where I got my big red hat

Chorus

Happy Ho! Ho! Ho! to you! (18x)

In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas
I love you baby

When all our dreams come true

""They've got cars big as bars they've got rivers of gold

You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot

Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

Things are different since you've been here last
Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past
Maybe you can bring us some hope this year
Visions of sugar plums have disappeared
Do you remember sleigh riding in the snow
And dancing all night to ""Baby Please Come Home""
Today's celebration is bittersweet
There's mothers and children in the street

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
So it's Christmas once more

What a bright time it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Man it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh the fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Oh mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no no no
Aw baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see no no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Just walking talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

[Chorus]
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

T's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the Five and Ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart right within your heart

Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!

[Verse 1]
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus (kissing kissing Santa Claus)
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep

[Chorus]
Then I saw mommy tickle tickle (tickle tickle Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

[Bridge]
He saw mommy kissing (kissing kissing Santa Claus)
I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

[Verse 2]
Then I saw mommy tickle (tickle tickle Santa Claus)

Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

[Repeat from 9th line]

Dashing through the snow (Rudolph)
In a one-horse open sleigh (today)
O'er the fields we go (Rudolph)
Laughing all the way (today)

Bells on bob-tail ring
Making our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells jingle-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

I love those JINGLE bells
Those holiday JINGLE bells
All those happy JINGLE BE double LLES

Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead

Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know

How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say

He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day

So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

[Verse 1]
Sleigh bells ring are you listenin'?
In the lane snow is glist’nin'
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walkin’ in a winter wonderland

[Verse 2]
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Chorus]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" We'll say ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town

[Verse 3]
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Circus Clown
We’ll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

[Verse 4]
When it snows ain’t it thrillin'
Though your nose get’s a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

[Verse 1]
Christmas night another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

[Refrain]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

[Refrain]
Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Oh Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone

Snow is falling down
Prayers are being answered
Miracles all around
From afar I've loved you
But never let it show
And every year another
December comes and goes

Always watching
Never reaching
But...

[Chorus]
This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas
I'm not afraid to fall
So I'm at your door with nothing more

In all this white you'll see me like
You've never seen me yet
Wrapped in red (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Blue is where I've been
Green can't buy me you
Silver bells remind me
That mistletoe's for two
So I found a color
That only tells the truth
That paints a picture
Of how I feel for you

This Christmas
I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas

There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's december it
And reassemble it (oh yeah)

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Verse:
At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?

With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Pre-Chorus:
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me

Bridge:
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow and
They believe again

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all

Christmas coming around again eh?

Well I thought about it I couldn't be bothered
Well it's the thought that counts innit

Kim Wilde as usual kidding myself though arent't I
It's hopeless really it's pathetic I suppose in a way
It is yeah - hello who is this?
Merry Christmas Melvyn
It can't be
Come on Mel how about pulling a cracker
By the look of you darling I think I already have
Get it

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple try to stop
Come on Melly-pops

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
Pumpkin pie anyone?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
This is so corny
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Wow I am in the most almighty Christmas groove
I haven't had this much fun
Since ""Two little boys"" was number one
If my friends could see me now
How do I look?
Ridiculous
You little tease
A dance Kimberley?

I do love a nice sax break
Yeah me too Kim but let's wait till the record's over
Kim do you think our love will last forever?
No
Couple of years maybe?
No
Do you think we'll make it to the end of the record?
How long is that - exactly?

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
All together now
Voices singing let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Excuse me can I sing something now?
Get lost Griff!
Well that's nice...

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Root beer anyone?
Later we'll have pumpkin pie
And we'll do some carolling
There's plenty of pumpkin pie left by the way
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Do you mind Melvyn?
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Wow yeah that was fantastic
Very nice
Let's do it again! One two three four...
Strewth

Rockin' around the Christmas tree

He overdid it with the pumpkin pie
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Merry Christmas everybody!

This year to save me from tears

Once bitten and twice as shy
I kept my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

""Merry Christmas"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
And if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 3]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

My baby's coming home for Christmas

'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window

Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

Five more on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go

[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]
You were handsome!
You were pretty Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum you're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God it's our last

[Chorus: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Verse 6: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
""I could have been someone""
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

[Outro: Shane Macgowan & Kirsty MacColl]
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

[Intro]
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live forever more because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""Let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today
And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted ""let everyone know there is hope for all to find peace""

[Outro]
Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord that sin may not enslave us  (So praise the lord)
And love may reign once more

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be if he won't be here)
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feigning joy and surprise at the gifts we despise
Over mulled wine with you
On the 25th day of the 12th month
The sleigh bells are in time ringing true

[Pre-Chorus]
How we cling each noel to that snowflake's hope in hell
That it won't end

Don't let the bells end
Christmas time
Just let them ring peace

Well the weather is cruel
And the season of yule warms the heart
But it still hurts
You've got your career
Spend the best part of last year apart
And it still hurts

[Pre-Chorus]
So that's why I pray each and every Christmas day
That it won't end

Poised underneath the mistletoe leaf
And you're not here
You went away upon boxing day
Now how the hell am I going to make it into the new year?

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
(Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears

[Verse 3]
A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year to save me from tears (Ohh)

[Outro]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone I'll give it to someone special
Special...

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Tou better watch out better not cry you better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Here he comes. he comes
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for everyone's Christmas joys
Tito had just one desire
That he gets a new guitar
But he wants a guarantee
That it won't play out of key
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop click click click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head

He began to dance around
O
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me
Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmaswe wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year
The jackson 5 wanna wish everyboy a merry merry christmas and a groovy new year
The jackson 5 wanna wish everyboy a merry merry christmas and a groovy new year
We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmaswe wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year

Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 1]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home

Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days untill you coming home
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep

""Bah humbug!"" No that's too strong
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from

Last year ski shop
Encounter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines

So deck those halls trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!

Flashback to springtime saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried we said we'd keep in touch

Didn't of course 'til summertime
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree

Now the calendar's just one page
And of course I am excited
Tonight's the night but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks no party lights
It's Christmas Eve gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites

Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go

Forget it it's cold it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?

So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!

""I'm spending this one alone"" he said
""Need a break; this year's been crazy.""
I said ""Me too but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending! ""

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Couldn't miss this one this year!

Are you hanging up your stocking on the wall?
Is it time that every Santa has a ball?
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
Does he tug upon a sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best?
And she's up and rock n rolling with the rest
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now it's only just begun
What will your daddy do
When he sees your mamma kissing Santa Claus?
Ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh
Are you hinging up your socking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you rattle down the hillside
In the buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head then you will say
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
So here it is Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now

When I was a child I used to wonder
How Santa put my toys under the tree
I said ""Momma can you tell me how this can be?""
When there ain't no chimneys in the projects?
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)

Momma sat me down and said ""Baby
Santa Clause does magic things
As soon as you're asleep a chimney will appear
And in the morning you will see all he brings
Don't you worry that their ain't no chimney's in the projects""
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the projects

Now I'm all grown and I see
It was the ? that got that magic dime
But Momma now I know that you were the one
There ain't no chimneys in the projects
Not in the ghetto
Ain't no chimneys in the projects

Momma was the one
It was Momma Momma Momma

I gave you my heart
Merry Christmas

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
It's been a year you know it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it
Merry Christmas I love you and I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart

And they shouted out with glee

You'll go down in history!""

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!""

[Verse 1]
Last December when we were together
I remember prayin' it was forever
Didn't know like the snow our love would melt away
Spring went by and then the summer started
Mid-July I was still brokenhearted
Autumn leaves have left the trees but these feelings still remain
Seems I'm not forgetting you as quickly as I wanted to
Now winter's on its way

[Chorus]
Yeah at Christmas I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be
C'est la vie
Yeah I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas

[Verse 2]
I know moving on is never easy
Wish my heart could change like the seasons
Someone send a happy end to my winter's tale
Now I'm building me a great big snowman
When I hold him we'll be two hearts frozen
All alone I'll keep him cold to make sure that he stays
I am trying my very best
But now I face the hardest test
As I've no festive cheer

[Chorus]
Yeah at Christmas I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be
C'est la vie
Yeah I've spent all year wishing you were here at--

[Bridge]
Can't help but think about you when I'm all alone
Each time I hear Sinatra on my radio
I'd be in Christmas heaven if only you were present
Maybe you're somewhere out there on your way to me

[Chorus]
Yeah at Christmas I can't help but miss ya
The memories of you and me evergreen
It's a time of joy but for me it's bittersweet
At Christmas I'm still reminiscing
'Bout everything we used to be
C'est la vie
Yeah I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas
Oh at Christmas oh wo-o-oah whoo
Yeah I've spent all year wishing you were here at Christmas

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

[Chorus]
Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh I wanna have him beside me like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th by that fireplace oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
If he will be if he will be here
(Santa tell me Santa tell me)
Oh woah

[Chorus]
Santa tell me (Santa tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Have a holly jolly Christmas

Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

I really can't stay (Baby it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But I can call you a ride)
This evening has been (I'm so glad that you dropped in)
So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise)
My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait what are you still livin' home for?)
So really I'd better scurry (Your driver his name is Murray)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh we're both adults so who's keepin' score?)
What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice)
If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice)
Ooh you really know how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To cast a spell (One look at you and then I fell)
I ought to say ""No no no sir"" (Then you really ought to go go go)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (Well Murray he just pulled up outside)

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson John Legend & Both]
Oh I really can't stay
(I understand baby)
Baby it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I simply should go (Text me when you get home)
Oh I'm supposed to say no (Mm I guess that's respectable)
This welcome has been (I've been lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (But you better go before it storms)
My sister will be suspicious (Well gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Oh he loves my music baby I'm sure)
My gossipy neighbor is vicious (I'm a genie tell me what your wish is)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Oh that's somethin' we should probably explore)
I've got to get home (Oh baby I'm well aware)
Say lend me a coat (Oh keep it girl I don't care)
You've really been grand (I feel it when you touch my hands)
But don't you see? (I want you to stay it's not up to me)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Well they can talk but what do they know?)
At least there will be plenty implied (Oh let them mind their business and go-)
Uh ma'am I really can't stay

Baby just go
It's cold baby

[Verse 1]
We were warm and wonderful
Once upon a time
But now we're frozen hanging by a thread
Can we wait a minute?
Or can we just try to try?
'Cause my favorite day is coming up ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'll say to Dad when he sees the empty chair
Don't want to hear my mom say ""Told you so""
Waiting for Santa in my bed is no fun if you're not there
And I don't want to be angry at mistletoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

[Bridge]
Darling I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year

Break my heart on Boxing Day
Just please can we make it to Christmas?

[Intro]
Ooo Ooo

[Verse 1: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
But I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

It barely took a breath to realize
We’re going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Pre-Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Verse 2: Blake]
Thought I was done for thought that love had died
But you came along I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you baby
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas

[Pre-Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too

[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Bridge: Gwen & Blake]
I never thought I’d find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oooh (thank you baby)

[Outro: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Be merry and bright

Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Verse 1]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep

[Bridge]
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

[Chorus 2]
Five more on my own
Four more days
Three more dreams mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go
Five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days untill you coming home
Three more wishes I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep
One more sleep

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?

I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Oh mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is no no no
Aw baby it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see no no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

We waited all through the year
For the day to appear
When we could be together in harmony

You know the time will come
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony

I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

To see the joy in the children's eyes
The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away

It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
When the ones you love are there
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it's everywhere
There's something about Christmas time
Something about Christmas time
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day

Please tell me Christmas will never go away

[Verse 1]
Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off it just said this
I know exactly what I want this year
Santa can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want my baby baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe maybe (maybe maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow

[Chorus]
Santa can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa that's my only wish this year

[Verse 2]
Christmas Eve I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're coming to town
Santa can you hear me?
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh please make my wish come true
Santa can you hear me?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I want my baby baby (oh)
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe maybe (maybe maybe)
We'll be all the love under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
Santa can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree

[Bridge]
I hope my letter reaches you in time oh yeah
Bring me love I can call all mine oh yeah yeah
'Cause I have been so good so good this year
Can't be alone under the mistletoe

Dear Santa what happened to the plan we had?

And I wanna tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it so let's December it
And reassemble it oh yeah

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

Ho ho ho ho ho ho
It's Christmas time

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above

Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest of the people
Of the east and the west?
And maybe every once in a while
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile

It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a boy one day
That wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been

I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow
When they believe again

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness
Come on y'all it's Christmas time

Shake it up shake up the happiness
Wake it up wake up the happiness

Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby

And such happiness in the coming year
(Happiness in the coming year)
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair
And pretty pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peak
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep

Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
What a laugh it would have been
If daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
(Woo!)

Ho ho ho

There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's december it
And reassemble it (oh yeah)
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To feel the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say
I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness?
With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Get my grandma a reason to smile
Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can know some happiness with me
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snowing
Your boots have been

So they will know then
This love will grow in
Than to live again
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all

How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo

[Chorus 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Verse]
Pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that'll make them ring is the carol that you'll sing
Right within your heart

[Chorus 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
And the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Christmas night another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood

Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall

Down where the sea and city meet

Then all my troubles will be gone

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

Winter's on the wind
Sings familiar melodies
Chill starts setting in
Silver bells are casting spells
It all comes back again
Lay your troubles down
Let me hold you

Now all the signs appear
The Christmas trees the memories
They bring this time of year
Ghosts of winters past
Come in and whisper in your ear
Don't listen to a word they've told you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

It's only you and me
The world outside is frozen white
I know it's hard to see
I'll be your candle
Be your light
Be anything you need
Star above the night to guide you

To find the highest bow
Hang up your regrets and
Let them fade into the sound
The angel choirs and roaring fires
Magic lost and found
Love is all around
Let it find you

I'll keep you warm
Underneath the Christmas lights
Sing you through the silent nights
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm
Start a fire and feel it glow
As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
You don't have to face the cold alone no more
I'll keep you warm

Through the frightful weather
I will hold you tight
We'll stay warm together
This December night
Through the snow and through the storm
I'll keep you warm

As the winds begin to blow
Come inside and close the door
Now I know you've faced the cold alone before
But you don't have to face the cold alone no more
Because I'll keep you warm...

Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

Once in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed:
Mary was that mother mild
Jesus Christ her little Child

He came down to earth from heaven
Who is God and Lord of all
And His shelter was a stable
And His cradle was a stall;
With the poor and mean and lowly
Lived on earth our Saviour holy

And our eyes at last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love;
For that Child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone
Not in that poor lowly stable
With the oxen standing by
We shall see Him; but in heaven
Set at God's right hand on high;
When like stars His children crowned
All in white shall wait around

O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see Thee lie
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in Thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the Holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth

How silently how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him
Still the dear Christ enters in

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the Blessed Child
Where misery cries out to Thee
Son of the Mother mild
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door
The dark night wakes the glory breaks
And Christmas comes once more

O Holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel

Going through the hills on a night all starry
On the way to Bethlehem
Far away I heard a shepherd boy piping
On the way to Bethlehem

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King
Is come to bring us peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""Tell me shepherd boy piping tunes so merrily
On the way to Bethlehem
Who will hear your tunes on these hills so lonely
On the way to Bethlehem?

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for the joy that Christ the newborn King
Is come to bring peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""None may hear my pipes on these hills so lonely
On the way to Bethlehem;
But a King will hear me play sweet lullabies
When I get to Bethlehem.""

Angels in the sky came down from on high
Hovered over the manger where the babe was lying
Cradled in the arms of his mother Mary
Sleeping now at Bethlehem

""Where is the new King shepherd boy piping merrily
Is He there at Bethlehem?""
""I will find Him soon by the star shining brightly
In the sky o'vr Bethlehem.""

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the king of Kings
Is come to bring us peace on earth
And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem.""

""May I come with you shepherd boy piping merrily
Come with you to Bethlehem?
Pay my homage too at the new King's cradle
Is it far to Bethlehem?""

Angels in the sky brought this message nigh:
""Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King
Is born in the stable yonder born for you and me.""

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen.

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

We are called by his name
Little Lamb God bless thee

They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the Virgin Birth
I remember one Christmas Morning
A winters light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire

They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
They told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
And I looked to the Sky with excited eyes
'Till I woke with a yawn in the first Light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise

I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year
All anguish pain and sadness
Leave your Heart and let your road be clear
They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
Hallelujah Noel be it Heaven or hell
The Christmas we get we deserve

It's a narrow narrow make your bed
And learn to lie your lane;
For I'm ga'n oer the sea Fair Annie
A braw bride to bring hame.
Wi her I will get gowd and gear;
Wi you I neer got nane.
""But wha will bake my bridal bread
Or brew my bridal ale?
And wha will welcome my brisk bride
That I bring oer the dale?""
""It's I will bake your bridal bread
And brew your bridal ale
And I will welcome your brisk bride
That you bring oer the dale.""
""But she that welcomes my brisk bride
Maun gang like maiden fair;
She maun lace on her robe sae jimp
And braid her yellow hair.""
""But how can I gang maiden-like
When maiden I am nane?
Have I not born seven sons to thee
And am with child again?""
She's taen her young son in her arms
Another in her hand
And she's up to the highest tower
To see him come to land.
""Come up come up my eldest son
And look oer yon sea-strand
And see your father's new-come bride
Before she come to land.""
""Come down come down my mother dear
Come frae the castle wa!
I fear if langer ye stand there
Ye'll let yoursell down fa.""
And she gaed down and farther down
Her love's ship for to see
And the topmast and the mainmast
Shone like the silver free.
And she's gane down and farther down
The bride's ship to behold
And the topmast and the mainmast
They shone just like the gold.
She's taen her seven sons in her hand
I wot she didna fail;
She met Lord Thomas and his bride
As they came oer the dale.
""You're welcome to your house Lord Thomas
You're welcome to your land;
You're welcome with your fair ladye
That you lead by the hand.
""You're welcome to your ha's ladye
You're welcome to your bowers;
You're welcome to your hame ladye
For a' that's here is yours.""
""I thank thee Annie; I thank thee Annie
Sae dearly as I thank thee;
You're the likest to my sister Annie
That ever I did see.
""There came a knight out oer the sea
And steald my sister away;
The shame scoup in his company
And land whereer he gae!""
She hang ae napkin at the door
Another in the ha
And a' to wipe the trickling tears
Sae fast as they did fa.
And aye she served the lang tables
With white bread and with wine
And aye she drank the wan water
To had her colour fine.
And he's taen down the silk napkin
Hung on a silver pin
And aye he wipes the tear trickling
A' down her cheik and chin.
And aye he turn'd him round about
And smil'd amang his men;
Says ""Like ye best the old ladye
Or her that's new come hame?""
When bells were rung and mass was sung
And a' men bound to bed
Lord Thomas and his new-come bride
To their chamber they were gaed.
Annie made her bed a little forbye
To hear what they might say;
""And ever alas!"" Fair Annie cried
""That I should see this day!
""Gin my seven sons were seven young rats
Running on the castle wa
And I were a grey cat mysell
I soon would worry them a'.
""Gin my seven sons were seven young hares
Running oer yon lilly lee
And I were a grew hound mysell
Soon worried they a' should be.""
And wae and sad Fair Annie sat
And drearie was her sang
And ever as she sobbd and grat
""Wae to the man that did the wrang!""
""My gown is on"" said the new-come bride
""My shoes are on my feet
And I will to Fair Annie's chamber
And see what gars her greet.
""What ails ye what ails ye Fair Annie
That ye make sic a moan?
Has your wine barrels cast the girds
Or is your white bread gone?
""O wha was't was your father Annie
Or wha was't was your mother?
And had ye ony sister Annie
Or had ye ony brother?""
""The Earl of Wemyss was my father
The Countess of Wemyss my mother;
And a' the folk about the house
To me were sister and brother.
""If the Earl of Wemyss was your father
I wot sae was he mine;
And it shall not be for lack o gowd
That ye your love sall tine.
""For I have seven ships o mine ain
A' loaded to the brim
And I will gie them a' to thee
Wi four to thine eldest son:
But thanks to a' the powers in heaven
That I gae maiden hame!

In the bleak midwinter frost wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron water like a stone;
Snow had fallen snow on snow snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter long ago
Our god heaven cannot hold him nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The lord God almighty jesus christ
Angels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But his mother only in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss
What can I give him poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb;
If I were a wise man I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give him: give my heart

The tree of life my soul hath seen
Laden with fruit and always green:
The trees of nature fruitless be
Compared with Christ the apple tree

His beauty doth all things excel:
By faith I know but ne'er can tell
The glory which I now can see
In Jesus Christ the apple tree

For happiness I long have sought
And pleasure dearly I have bought:
I missed of all; but now I see
'Tis found in Christ the apple tree

I'm weary with my former toil
Here I will sit and rest awhile:
Under the shadow I will be
Of Jesus Christ the apple tree

This fruit doth make my soul to thrive
It keeps my dying faith alive;
Which makes my soul in haste to be
With Jesus Christ the apple tree

Born in a stable so bare
Born so long ago
Born 'neath light of star
He who loved us so
Far away silent he lay
Born today your homage pay
For Christ is born for aye
Born on Christmas Day
Cradled by mother so fair
Tender her lullaby
Over her son so dear
Angel hosts fill the sky
Far away silent he lay
Born today your homage pay
For Christ is born for aye
Born on Christmas Day
Wise men from distant far land
Sheperds from starry hills
Worship this babe so rare
Hearts with his warmth he fills
Far away silent he lay
Born today your homage pay
For Christ is born for aye
Born on Christmas Day
Love in that stable was born
Into our hearts to flow
Innocent dreaming babe
Make me thy love to know
Far away silent he lay
Born today your homage pay
For Christ is born for aye
Born on Christmas Day

Aus Gottes ew'gem Rat
Hat sie ein Kind geboren
Wohl zu der halben Nacht

How do you capture the wind on the water?
How do you count all the stars in the sky?
How can you measure the love of a mother?
Or how can you write down a baby's first cry?

Candlelight angel light firelight and star-glow
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn
Gloria! Gloria in excelsis deo
Angels are singing; the Christ child is born

Shepherds and wise men will kneel and adore him
Seraphim round him their vigil will keep
Nations proclaim him their Lord and their Saviour
But Mary will hold him and sing him to sleep

Candlelight angel light firelight and star-glow
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn
Gloria! Gloria in excelsis deo
Angels are singing; the Christ child is born

Find him at Bethlehem laid in a manger
Christ our Redeemer asleep in the hay
Godhead incarnate and hope of salvation
A child with his mother that first Christmas Day

Candlelight angel light firelight and star-glow
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn
Gloria! Gloria in excelsis deo
Angels are singing; the Christ child is born

I.

       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep mine Holy One!
My flesh my Lord!—what name? I do not know
A name that seemeth not too high or low
       &nbsp       &nbspToo far from me or heaven:
My Jesus that is best! that word being given
By the majestic angel whose command
Was softly as a man's beseeching said
When I and all the earth appeared to stand
       &nbsp       &nbspIn the great overflow
Of light celestial from his wings and head.
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my saving One!


II.

And art Thou come for saving baby-browed
And speechless Being—art Thou come for saving?
The palm that grows beside our door is bowed
By treadings of the low wind from the south
A restless shadow through the chamber waving:
Upon its bough a bird sings in the sun
But Thou with that close slumber on Thy mouth
Dost seem of wind and sun already weary.
Art come for saving O my weary One?

III.

Perchance this sleep that shutteth out the dreary
Earth-sounds and motions opens on Thy soul
       &nbspHigh dreams on fire with God;
High songs that make the pathways where they roll
More bright than stars do theirs; and visions new
Of Thine eternal Nature's old abode.
       &nbspSuffer this mother's kiss
       &nbspBest thing that earthly is
To glide the music and the glory through
Nor narrow in Thy dream the broad upliftings
       &nbspOf any seraph wing.
Thus noiseless thus. Sleep sleep my dreaming One!

IV.

The slumber of His lips meseems to run
Through my lips to mine heart to all its shiftings
Of sensual life bringing contrariousness
In a great calm. I feel I could lie down
As Moses did and die[7]—and then live most.
I am 'ware of you heavenly Presences
That stand with your peculiar light unlost
Each forehead with a high thought for a crown
Unsunned i' the sunshine! I am 'ware. Ye throw
No shade against the wall! How motionless
Ye round me with your living statuary
While through your whiteness in and outwardly
Continual thoughts of God appear to go
Like light's soul in itself. I bear I bear
To look upon the dropt lids of your eyes
Though their external shining testifies
To that beatitude within which were
Enough to blast an eagle at his sun:
I fall not on my sad clay face before ye—
       &nbsp       &nbspI look on His. I know
My spirit which dilateth with the woe
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspOf His mortality
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspMay well contain your glory.
       &nbsp       &nbspYea drop your lids more low.
Ye are but fellow-worshippers with me!
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my worshipped One!


V.

We sate among the stalls at Bethlehem;
The dumb kine from their fodder turning them
       &nbspSoftened their hornèd faces
       &nbspTo almost human gazes
       &nbspToward the newly Born:
The simple shepherds from the star-lit brooks
       &nbspBrought visionary looks
As yet in their astonied hearing rung
       &nbspThe strange sweet angel-tongue:
The magi of the East in sandals worn
       &nbspKnelt reverent sweeping round
With long pale beards their gifts upon the ground
       &nbspThe incense myrrh and gold
These baby hands were impotent to hold:
So let all earthlies and celestials wait
       &nbspUpon Thy royal state.
       &nbspSleep sleep my kingly One!

VI.

I am not proud—meek angels ye invest
New meeknesses to hear such utterance rest
On mortal lips—""I am not proud""—not proud!
Albeit in my flesh God sent His Son
Albeit over Him my head is bowed
As others bow before Him still mine heart
Bows lower than their knees. O centuries
That roll in vision your futurities
       &nbsp       &nbspMy future grave athwart—
Whose murmurs seem to reach me while I keep
       &nbsp       &nbspWatch o'er this sleep—
Say of me as the Heavenly said—""Thou art
The blessedest of women!""—blessedest
Not holiest not noblest no high name
Whose height misplaced may pierce me like a shame
When I sit meek in heaven!
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspFor me for me
God knows that I am feeble like the rest!
I often wandered forth more child than maiden
Among the midnight hills of Galilee
       &nbsp       &nbspWhose summits looked heaven-laden
Listening to silence as it seemed to be
God's voice so soft yet strong so fain to press
Upon my heart as heaven did on the height
And waken up its shadows by a light
And show its vileness by a holiness.
Then I knelt down most silent like the night
       &nbsp       &nbspToo self-renounced for fears
Raising my small face to the boundless blue
Whose stars did mix and tremble in my tears:
God heard them falling after with His dew.

VII.

So seeing my corruption can I see
This Incorruptible now born of me
This fair new Innocence no sun did chance
To shine on (for even Adam was no child)
Created from my nature all defiled
This mystery from out mine ignorance—
Nor feel the blindness stain corruption more
Than others do or I did heretofore?
Can hands wherein such burden pure has been
Not open with the cry ""unclean unclean""
More oft than any else beneath the skies?
       &nbsp       &nbspAh King ah Christ ah son!
The kine the shepherds the abasèd wise
       &nbsp       &nbspMust all less lowly wait
       &nbsp       &nbspThan I upon Thy state.
       &nbspSleep sleep my kingly One!

VIII.

Art Thou a King then? Come His universe
Come crown me Him a King!
Pluck rays from all such stars as never fling
       &nbspTheir light where fell a curse
And make a crowning for this kingly brow!—
What is my word? Each empyreal star
       &nbsp       &nbspSits in a sphere afar
       &nbsp       &nbspIn shining ambuscade:
       &nbsp       &nbspThe child-brow crowned by none
       &nbsp       &nbspKeeps its unchildlike shade.
       &nbsp       &nbspSleep sleep my crownless One!

IX.

Unchildlike shade! No other babe doth wear
An aspect very sorrowful as Thou.
No small babe-smiles my watching heart has seen
To float like speech the speechless lips between
No dovelike cooing in the golden air
No quick short joys of leaping babyhood.
       &nbsp       &nbspAlas our earthly good
In heaven thought evil seems too good for Thee;
       &nbsp       &nbspYet sleep my weary One!

X.

And then the drear sharp tongue of prophecy
With the dread sense of things which shall be done
Doth smite me inly like a sword: a sword?
That ""smites the Shepherd."" Then I think aloud
The words ""despised""—""rejected""—every word
Recoiling into darkness as I view
       &nbsp       &nbspThe Darling on my knee.
Bright angels—move not—lest ye stir the cloud
Betwixt my soul and His futurity!
I must not die with mother's work to do
       &nbsp       &nbspAnd could not live-and see.

XI.

       &nbspIt is enough to bear
       &nbspThis image still and fair
       &nbspThis holier in sleep
       &nbspThan a saint at prayer
       &nbspThis aspect of a child
       &nbspWho never sinned or smiled;
       &nbspThis Presence in an infant's face;
       &nbspThis sadness most like love
       &nbspThis love than love more deep
       &nbspThis weakness like omnipotence
       &nbspIt is so strong to move.
       &nbspAwful is this watching place
       &nbspAwful what I see from hence—
       &nbspA king without regalia
       &nbspA God without the thunder
       &nbspA child without the heart for play;
       &nbspAy a Creator rent asunder
       &nbspFrom His first glory and cast away
       &nbspOn His own world for me alone
To hold in hands created crying—Son!

XII.

       &nbspThat tear fell not on Thee
Beloved yet thou stirrest in thy slumber!
Thou stirring not for glad sounds out of number
Which through the vibratory palm-trees run
       &nbspFrom summer-wind and bird
       &nbspSo quickly hast thou heard
       &nbspA tear fall silently?
       &nbspWak'st thou O loving One?—
